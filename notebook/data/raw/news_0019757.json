Most advocates use it on their face, but Christie, true to form, also experiments elsewhere — to eradicate the wrinkly knees most middle-aged women are afflicted by. 'The treatment sounded too good to be true and felt like a hot stone massage,' she says. 'However, the faint horizontal lines above my knees were indeed gone afterwards.' That said, she admits not all her non-surgical treatments are enjoyable: 'There is some truth to the old adage: 'No pain, no gain.' Injections, lasers and energy treatments are rarely completely pain-free.' Still, the estimated £66 million fortune Christie has made from her beauty presumably helps to lessen the sting. Apple snacks to stop over-eating Unlike most models, Christie is refreshingly candid about her reliance on Botox — she just doesn't have the procedure administered where you might expect Largely vegan since reading about dubious slaughterhouse practices aged 12, size 8 Christie has been following a low-sugar, no-dairy, clean-eating diet since before 'Deliciously Ella' Woodward was even born. It's a regime that would make even the most disciplined of women wince. Breakfast is a sheep's milk yoghurt with organic berries, chia seeds and raw oatmeal. Plus, she eats an apple 20 minutes before meals to leave her feeling fuller and therefore less likely to overindulge. Lunch is a salad and her afternoon snack a kale, lime, orange and avocado juice made by the private chef Christie describes as 'her great luxury in life'. If she's still feeling peckish, she indulges in a homemade pumpkin-seed mix sprinkled with Himalayan salt, before eating brown rice with roasted red and yellow peppers and dried fennel for dinner. To ensure she and her family get an abundance of health-boosting vitamins, Brinkley attempts to include as many colours of foods as possible in her diet. As wacky as her approach might sound, many experts believe those brightest in colour — such as tomatoes and red peppers — are highest in cancer-preventing antioxidants. 'For many, many, many years I've always said I go for as many colours as possible,' says Christie, who is currently single. 'That's my main concept for making sure my kids get all the nutrients — making sure they get the deep greens, yellows and reds and purples.' Aware that too much sugar can disrupt collagen levels in the skin, potentially causing wrinkles, she crushes blueberries in a blender to 'taste like you're indulging in ice cream'. Well, that 27in waist won't whittle away on its own, eh? Fortunately, Christie isn't completely saintly on the culinary front. Indulgences include a glass of red wine with dinner and a daily piece of organic dark chocolate. Plus, she claims with uncharacteristic abandon: 'Life is too short to not have oysters and champagne sometimes.' Exercising under the hairdryer Alexa Ray Joel, Christie Brinkley, and Sailor Brinkley Cook attend 'Celebrity Autobiography' at Guild Hall on August 26, 2016 in East Hampton, New York Brinkley is breezily dismissive of an exercise regime most sexagenarians would baulk at. Having once said she does a 'really easy' 100 push ups a day (30 of which are completed before her morning shower), her only prerequisite appears to be that her workouts are varied: 'I like to mix it up when I do have time for a workout. 'If I get into one thing, I get bored quickly and won't do it.' To that end, she practises yoga, runs, surfs, skis and swims — and, on a wackier front, walks down the beach waving her arms: 'I call it swimming down the beach. Kind of silly looking, but I don't care.' She is also devoted to Total Gym, a weights machine she keeps at her home in the celebrity-studded Hamptons, New York, on which she spends 15 minutes at a time. Brinkley — who has a deep-tissue massage at home every Sunday night and enjoys Epsom bath salts to unwind — has also declared herself 'hooked' on SoulCycle, a 45-minute exercise bike class held in a dark candlelit room to high-energy music. But she'd have us believe that, beneath the fads, she's really just an ordinary, time-pressed mother: 'I'll take advantage of the time I use drying my hair to do some lunges or squats.' And, she even adds: 'I do leg lifts while brushing my teeth!' Skin fillers to hold back the years Brinkley's youthful bloom is further boosted with fillers — gel injected beneath the skin's surface to plump its appearance. 'I have used fillers in super-tiny doses — and, just like make-up, the best ones are imperceptible,' she says. The model has the procedure — which she describes as 'a good solution' for wrinkles, pockmarks and scowls — both in her forehead to fill out an 'indentation' that was 'the legacy of a playground accident', and in the lines around her mouth. 'They can give the overall face a lift and also diminish fine lines,' Christie says. But she warns women not to go overboard: 'Use a very small amount because over-filling removes contours and gives you a flat face.' Exfoliating tips from the boys Christie also credits her smooth skin to a lesson learned from the opposite sex. 'In the beginning of my career I read an article about the reason that men always look five years younger than women is because they shave,' she explains. 'It said the daily exfoliation from shaving gives them that rapid cell turnover and keeps their skin glowing and looking so great. So I thought, well, I am just not going to let them have that advantage.' Instead of taking to her face with a razor she bought an exfoliator from a health food store — a product that was so abrasive 40 years ago she says it was 'like taking gravel off the street and rubbing it on your face. But I went ahead and did that and started exfoliating, exfoliating, exfoliating'. More recently, she has been using a £30 lactic-acid-filled cleanser that burns away dead skin. In addition to drinking 'tons' of water to keep her skin hydrated, Brinkley is 'religious about wearing sunscreen daily', claiming the sun 'wreaks havoc' on the skin and is its 'number one ager'. Checking make-up in natural light When it comes to cosmetics, Brinkley — who has graced an astonishing 500 magazine covers throughout the course of her career and in 2015 wrote a book, Timeless Beauty, about the tricks of her trade — suggests inspecting oneself outdoors before facing the public. 'The best tip I learned from my years of modelling is to check your make-up in natural light,' she says. 'Because doing it in the bathroom can be completely different from getting out in the daylight.' She's not content to limit herself to a one-dimensional inspection either: 'Check the side of your face, because a lot of people . . . completely forget about what's going on at the side. So you can see a line under here, or a stripe on the neck.' False lashes for red-carpet glamour Brinkley learned from her late mother Marjorie, who transformed her face with three staple items in her car mirror in 45 seconds, that less is more. 'All she did was pull on the outside of her eye, line the upper lids with a pencil, just above the lash, put her blush on — she always wore a bronzy, sunny colour — and this sort of orangey lipstick. And suddenly, she was just radiant.' But with advancing years, the model has started to rely on cream-based products that don't settle into fine lines, in neutral and golden tones. 'Eyebrows can thin as we age. I use pencil and powder,' says Christie, who also uses a primer underneath foundation to 'fill in any lines', and black mascara with brown eyeliner. That mega-watt smile is plumped up with a Tom Ford pale lipstick layered over a tawny lip liner. When a red-carpet appearance requires glamour, she says: 'I'll add lots of individual false lashes and wear a Sixties cat eye with liquid liner.' And if all else fails? 'Smile,' she says. 'Adopting a really positive attitude can work wonders to adding years to your life, a spring to your step, a sparkle to your eye.' Always wearing hair extensions Christie Brinkley poses with daughters Alexa Ray Joel (left) and Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook (right) at Christie Brinkley's 'Social Life Magazine' Cover Celebration on May 25, 2013 in Water Mill, New York Christie's tousled mane helped make her a household name. But motherhood and the menopause — both of which cause fluctuating hormone levels that affect hair growth — have thinned her famous locks in recent years. 'By a certain age most of us start to notice that making our hair look great just isn't that easy any longer. After each of my three pregnancies I noticed my ponytail got a bit smaller,' says Christie, who in addition to Alexa and Sailor also has son Jack, 21, from her third marriage to property developer Richard Taubman, later adopted by fourth husband Peter Cook. 'Not only is there less hair, but new strands seem to grow finer than they once did.' Not that a model of her calibre could possibly admit defeat, of course. In addition to six-weekly sessions with her colourist to keep away the dreaded grey, Christie uses clip-on extensions around the clock to give her hair volume. 'Longer, thicker hair will always make you look youthful,' says the American, who uses her own range of hair pieces from Hair2wear, which cost from around £30. 'And don't just save extensions for special occasions. I use mine at the gym, on rainy days and after a day at the beach.' She completes the big hair look by applying Pantene styling products at the roots and drying her locks upside down: 'Boom! You've got Beyonce hair.' Lastly, she has used Eighties staple Sun In to brighten her mane. 'I've said it for a million years, if you have hair colour like mine, you can extend the colour by using Sun In,' she says. 'Never use the squirter that comes with it. Take a tiny, tiny amount, like a cap-full, and dip a cotton ball in it and touch the roots. Blow it dry and it blends beautifully.'
