This could be a taste of what's to come from the upcoming generation of iPhones. \nSpeaking of smartphones, Apple could present an update to its iPhone SE, launched a year ago, which may get upgraded to 128GB of onboard storage. The brand's top-of-the-range models, the iPhone 7 and 7 plus, could also land in a new colour, bringing a flash of red to the top-end range. \nFor news on new-gen high-end iPhones and upcoming developments for iOS, Apple fans will have to wait until the firm's worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San José, California, June 5-9, 2017. \nThis isn't the first time that Apple has held a keynote in March. Last year's event saw the firm unveil a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro as well as the iPhone SE, a \"low-cost\" smartphone (although still priced US$399 or RM1,772) which packs the same specs as the iPhone 6s into a 4-inch handset. — AFP Relaxnews <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:45.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
