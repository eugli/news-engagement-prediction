Worton is no longer with the Gators football team - and that is coupled with the development that he's no longer listed on Florida's roster .\nIn three seasons with the Gators as a three-star signee from the 2014 class, Worton has totaled just 126 receiving yards and two touchdowns on 10 catches. One of those grabs came in the 2015 SEC Championship Game against Alabama, where he caught a 46-yard touchdown pass during the fourth quarter of a 29-15 loss.\nWorton appeared in just five games, starting one at Tennessee, as a junior in 2016 due to numerous ankle injuries and logged just 45 receiving yards on four catches. Eventually, he lost his footing in the rotation as youngsters like Tyrie Cleveland, Joshua Hammond and Freddie Swain started seeing more reps as the season went on. He didn’t make the trip with the team to Tampa for the Outback Bowl or to Atlanta for the SEC title game this past season.\nDuring the past three years, the 6-foot, 196-pound Worton has suffered an array of injuries, including a broken hand from an off-the-field incident midway during his freshman season.\nFlorida returns seven receivers in 2017 - Antonio Callaway, Cleveland, Dre Massey, Brandon Powell, Hammond, Swain and Rick Wells – while adding 2017 four-star commits Daquon Green and James Robinson. Three-star athlete Kadarius Toney, who will start off at quarterback in Gainesville, could be a potential option at receiver down the road for the Gators. Kalif Jackson made the switch from wide receiver to tight end midway this season, ITG has learned.\nAhmad Fulwood and Chris Thompson both completed their senior seasons by the end of the 2016 campaign.\n-", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/c1cs8f0lqmf54exq9s1g", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/c1cs8f0lqmf54exq9s1g)", "http://floridagators.com/roster.aspx?path=football"], "published": "2017-02-02T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:50:27.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
