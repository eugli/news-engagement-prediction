GOOGLE EARTH \nA Google Earth image of the four hectares of empty land suitable for residential development the church owns in Tai Tapu. It is worth a total of $1.6 million. \nThe property portfolio mainly includes churches, but also a 188-hectare Hawke's Bay forestry block with a rateable valuation of about $500,000, about 4ha of empty land suitable for residential development in Tai Tapu worth about $1.6m and an empty block of land opposite the Church of the Good Shepherd on the shores of Lake Tekapo worth $1m. \nREAD MORE: \nBut an Anglican spokesman said the money and property was held \"on trust\" for parishes across the diocese and could not be spent outside each individual parish. JOHN BISSET/FAIRFAXNZ \nAn empty block of land, outlined in red, opposite the Church of the Good Shepherd on the shores of Lake Tekapo owned by the church is worth about $1m. \nHe said the few investment properties owned by CPT were \"held to fund the ongoing operation of the church\". \n\"The CPT is the holding body for all the [parish] trusts. \n\"You can't take money from Papanui, for example, to pay central.\" GOOGLE EARTH \nA Google Earth image of the 188 hectare forestry block in Hawke's Bay the church owns. It has a rateable valuation of about $500,000. \nBishop Victoria Matthews did not answer questions from Stuff about the property and funds. Her response instead came in the form of a letter sent to all members of the Anglican diocese asking for their prayers. The full letter can be viewed below. Ad Feedback \n\"The media is focusing on our Cathedral in the Square building again. I find this rather sad at the time when our thoughts are most naturally with the families of those who died, those who were injured and the very large number of people affected by 22 February 2011,\" she wrote in the letter. \n\"It is so easy for those outside the church to forget that we are actually seeking God's will about the cathedral and reduce it all to dollars and cents.\" \nBut she did briefly address the CPT's cash and property holdings: \"I write to you at this time to simply remind you that we do hold land and investments, but that these are for parish and diocesan ministry and mission. CPT has no equity of its own.\" \nThe Anglican diocese's finances have come under scrutiny as it negotiates with the Government over how to fund the $100m Christ Church Cathedral restoration. \nThe CPT has a $42m insurance payout on the cathedral to spend on the restoration, while campaign group Great Christchurch Buildings Trust (GCBT) has pledged to raise $15m from donors and about $10m has been offered by the Government. \nMatthews is concerned it may prove difficult to raise money for the $30m funding shortfall on the project, according to sources close to the process . \nThe CPT has sold at least $9m worth of property in central Christchurch since 2000, land records show. \nIt sold 151 Cambridge Tce, formerly the site of the Santorini Greek restaurant, for $1.7m in 2000. The site was later redeveloped as the Deloitte office building. \nIt also sold a couple of residential properties in the central city, each for about $500,000, in 2002; a seven-storey office block on Hereford St for $3.75m in 2004; and a retail building on High St for about $1m in the same year. CPT also sold a retail block on Colombo St to the Government for $1.8m in 2014. The Government purchased the land for the convention centre anchor project. \nTHE BISHOP'S LETTER:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T16:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:54:26.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
