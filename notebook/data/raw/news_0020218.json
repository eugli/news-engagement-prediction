PUBLISHED: 10:33,  53, Thu, Feb 9, 2017 GETTY Trump is being urged not to term the Muslim Brotherhood terrorists in case they become terrorists \nThe Muslim Brotherhood includes members who have “engaged in violence”, a CIA report says, but labelling them as a danger to western society may in itself fuel extremism. \nThe Muslim Brotherhood claims it has “rejected violence as a matter of official policy and opposed al-Qaeda and Islamic State” but has bases in countries on terror watch lists, which as Tunisia, Kuwait and Jordan. Related articles Canada opposes Trump's campaign promise to alter free trade agreement \nBut the CIA document says “a minority of MB Muslim Brotherhood members have engaged in violence, most often in response to harsh regime repression, perceived foreign occupation, or civil conflicts”. \nIt continued: “MB groups enjoy widespread support across the Near East-North Africa region and many Arabs and Muslims worldwide would view an MB designation as an affront to their core religious and societal values. GETTY Donald Trump is taking a hardline approach to radical Islamic terror \n“Moreover, a US designation would probably weaken MB leaders’ arguments against violence and provide ISIS and al-Qaeda additional grist for propaganda to win followers and support, particularly for attacks against U.S. interests.” \nThe CIA is running the risk of alienating the President’s inner circle once again as its views are in flagrant opposition to those of Mike Pompeo, director of the agency, who dubbed the Brotherhood “radical Islam” and accused them of infiltrating small town America with poisonous ideology. Horrifying acts of terrorism Tue, January 31, 2017 Some of the most horrifying terrorist attacks of all time from 9/11 to Mumbai, these murderous acts killed several thousands of people and caused millions of pounds of damage to properties worldwide.

These are not moderate politicians. They support, on an ideological level, terrorism. They cooperate with terrorists. \n“They give a platform for terrorists. But there is not sufficient evidence to show they send their own members to commit terrorism, and that is the standard for a designation.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:03:17.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
