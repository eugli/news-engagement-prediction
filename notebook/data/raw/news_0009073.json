It means Sir Daniel’s pay package has almost doubled since 2009, according to analysis by the Times Educational Supplement.\nSir Daniel gets paid three times more than Prime Minister Theresa May (pictured)\nTheresa May receives £150,402, while David Cameron’s package for 2015-16 was £149,440.\nSir Daniel’s package also dwarfs that earned by the headmaster of Eton College, Simon Henderson, who receives around £240,000.\nIt comes amid mounting questions over the use of taxpayer money in academies, which are independent from council control and are free to set their own staff pay. Most of the Harris Federation’s funding comes from government grants.\nIt operates 41 schools, most of which have been rated outstanding by Ofsted inspectors. A trust spokesman said: ‘Our Board recognises leadership is among the key drivers of our success, so leaders throughout our federation are rewarded for their contribution.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:52:10.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
