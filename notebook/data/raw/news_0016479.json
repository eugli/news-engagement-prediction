TNN | Feb 7, 2017, 05.50 AM IST Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. (File photo) NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday slapped a cost of Rs 10,000 on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for delay in filing a response to the defamation suit filed by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) against him and former cricketer Kirti Azad . The court also slapped Rs 30,000 as cost on Azad for the same reason. The association, in its defamation suit, has sought Rs 2.5 crore each as damages from them. The HC made it clear Kejriwal and Azad's delayed written statements to the suit will be taken on record after payment of the costs imposed on them. The court's joint registrar Anil Kumar Sisodia said that the cost imposed on the CM should be paid to the cricketing body; while out of the Rs 30,000 imposed on the suspended BJP MP, Rs 20,000 should also be paid to DDCA, while the remaining amount be deposited in the Delhi High Court Legal Service Authority . The joint registrar had reserved his order on January 15 on the issue whether their reply would be taken on record or not. His order came on Kejriwal and Azad's separate applications seeking condonation of delay in filing their respective written statements in the defamation suit. Kejriwal and Azad are facing defamation suit filed by DDCA for alleged defamatory criticism of the functioning and finances of the cricketing body .
