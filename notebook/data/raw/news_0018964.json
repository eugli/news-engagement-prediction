I work in the fashion and media industry, and I've made peace with the fact that while I'll always find Vogue visually compelling, I'll never truly identify with the content. I'm a plus-size working class woman who has zero interest in four-figure purchases or what a socialite wore to a party at the Met or who backstabbed who to control a legendary fashion house. \nInstead, I prefer my fashion content to come with a healthy dose of democratization, approachability, and inclusivity. There are plenty of publications doing that, but Vogue just isn't one of them, and they aren't trying to be. The Vogue brand has always been about being aspirational, not relatable — that's why it's so disappointing to see them embody the former but be exalted as the latter. \"Maybe it was time that I realized my curls were special\" https://t.co/U2s6Yi1c28 Source: Teen Vogue on Twitter \nIt's important to acknowledge that as little as 10 years ago, it was difficult to find anyone on a magazine cover that wasn't thin, white, beautiful, or all of the above. In certain respects, the industry has made huge strides — in 2007, perhaps, this cover would have been revolutionary. In 2017, it feels pretty gorgeously average — and that's a good thing. It's reassuring that we've reached the point where a cover like this feels tedious and expected. But this can't be our stopping point. We still have a long way to go, and for our part, there's no way to control the editorial decision-making that goes into producing a cover like the one Vogue just released — or any other publication, for that matter.

We can refuse to accept the narratives of \"power\" and \"diversity\" being force-fed to us and instead praise an image like the Vogue cover for what it actually is: A bunch of high-profile models, carefully orchestrated by a major fashion publication to sell as many issues as possible — and that's OK. Not everything has to be pegged to power and inclusion — in fact, doing so silences the things that actually are . \nInstead, focus on sharing and promoting content that is, and doing so overtly — everything from Teen Vogue to Refinery29 to, ahem, Bustle , and even your favorite blogs and social media accounts. There are so many stories that actually push boundaries and break molds that, while they may never get to to cover of Vogue, are definitely worth all those \"powerful\" headlines. \nSo, sure: It's always great to see a gorgeous photograph of a group of women (especially knowing that it represents career success and dollar signs for those women) — but that's where praise for the Vogue cover should begin and end. Ultimately, we need to stop settling for headlines that tell us what's powerful, and instead demand the content speak for itself.
