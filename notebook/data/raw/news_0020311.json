By Niall Neeson on 8 February 2017 \nSo that’s a wrap, then! Simple Session 17 came and went off in Estonia this weekend just past. We hope you managed to catch it live on Sunday via our broadcast on Red Bull TV , hosted by skateboarding legend Chris ‘Dune’ Pastras . If not, you still have the chance to watch the re-live with all the highlights on Red Bull TV . Robin Bolian – Backside 360 Melon over the hip © Alexey Lapin \nIf you couldn’t make it, fear not, because as well as Alexey Lapin’s rather splendid photographic essay from the historic Tallinn event, we also had Czech maestro David Chvatal fly in to put together one of his definitive wrap edits for you. Enjoy all the best moves and drama of the entire weekend including practice, finals and best trick in the video above. Afterthoughts © Alexey Lapin \nAs well as some welcome returning faces, among the 64 entrants were some new additions to the Simple Session mayhem – a large contingent of the Habitat team including Silas Baxter-Neal, Marius Syvanen and Josh Matthews all made their Estonian debuts alongside Pat Duffy , who brought his children along to see daddy put it about in that legendary form of his. Leo Lukin – Front Blunt © Alexey Lapin \nThe Saku Suurhall arena was also home to three tiers of retail and activity villages where you could mill around, skate a little pre-fab course, get some pretty good food and meet new people, which made for a very civilised ambience within a crowd which was drawn from beyond just Estonia judging by some of the accents you could hear. Max Kruglov – Back Noseblunt © Alexey Lapin \nThe 64 entrants were distilled down to the final 12 for Sunday’s live finals , each of whom had two runs to throw down around a much-improved course. \nThe top slot saw Aurélien Giraud retain his title and mark him down as the man to beat in Europe right now. As part of his prize he is flying out to compete at Hart Lines in Detroit, one of the highest-stakes events in skating today. Yuto Horigome – Backside 360 Nosegrab © Alexey Lapin \nSo please do enjoy all the bangers from three days of solid dawn-to-dusk rippage. Then start making plans to get out there next year to break up the winter at what is always a super weekend of skating and socialisers in the fabulous city of Tallinn. \nThank you to Risto , Mario and everyone else for having us! \nFinal results :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T16:27:07.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
