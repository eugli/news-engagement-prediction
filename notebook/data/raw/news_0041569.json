They should drop their rates to \"reasonable levels\" below 10 per cent, he said. \nIndependent senator Nick Xenophon said the banks were being irresponsible by leaving rates so high. \n\"We are being gouged with credit cards and we actually need some fundamental reforms,\" he said. \"We really need to look at greater market competition or the banks need to really explain themselves in why they are gouging consumers in this way.\" \nGovernment backbenchers are vowing to put further pressure on the banks with more public hearings due next month. \nLiberal MP and bank critic Scott Buchholz also believed the last round of hearings helped trigger ANZ's decision. \n\"We will have the banks appearing in the next fortnight in Canberra, along with the Australian Banking Association, where I will continue to take a similar line of questioning with those banks that haven't taken the commercial choice to shift their interest rates yet,\" he said.
