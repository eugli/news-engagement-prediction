The smoke was so thick and was bellowing out into the street I had to keep other people away from the fumes.” \nHelena Holder, 19, studying German at University College London lives three doors down from the inferno. \nShe said: “We noticed this strange mist and thought it was heavy rain but then saw the flashing lights and knew something wasn’t right. \n“We were very anxious to see if anyone was inside. Firemen were wearing respiratory gear so obviously that suggests something bad. We were worried the fire would spread to us because we’re very close.” \nA worker at The Elephants Head pub said: “We had to empty the whole place. The Oxford Arms and Poppies as well, all the venues near the junction. The whole area was closed down but thankfully no one got hurt. Everyone is safe.” \nLondon Fire Brigade said the cause of the fire was still being investigated.
