By Julie Schott Feb 21, 2017 \"People used to be guided by magazines like, 'this is the trend of the season,'\" says Dior Makeup creative and image director Peter Philips. \"Nowadays, depending on your mood, and how you want to express yourself, you can go matte, extreme, natural, whatever you want to do.\" That's what inspired Philips to approach lip color in a different way for his latest launch, Dior Addict Lacquer Sticks , a collection of 18 high-shine new lip pigments split into four categories–Pastel, Neon, Classic and Wild. To celebrate the collection, we talked to Philips about how to make drugstore products look expensive and what he's learned from working with Bella Hadid.

Contouring is here to stay I've been contouring since day one. It's our job [as makeup artists] to help sculpt–extreme or subtle–a face, for a photoshoot or a fashion show. I've never used one foundation. It's always a combination of two, three shades; just to start sculpting the face. I don't want that to be dead. But when I see somebody applying it badly–sometimes you see on those makeup tutorials, really extreme ways to apply contouring–that doesn't serve anybody. But on the other hand, it's part of the fun of makeup, to play around. 2. Thorough blending is essential If you have your products, whether they're cheaper or more expensive products, the moment you blend everything nicely–your foundation is nicely blended, there's no lines and the brush blends in and seems like it's part of your skin, your lip is beautifully applied, and if you use two colors, there's a nice gradient–it looks much more sophisticated. 3. Experiment with lipstick textures My goal is to make sure in my collections in general [there's] always some matte, some shine, some sparkle. Even in Dior, there was no matte in the collection. And that was kind of for me like, 'We need matte. I can push and tease with extreme colors and maybe some extreme formulas like I did for example, [the] launch of Rouge Dior, when I did the extreme shades. I made sure first that the base was guaranteed; that every woman could find her rose, her beige, her matte red, as well as her satin orange. All those classic basic lipstick shades which are almost essentials, are guaranteed there. Courtesy of Dior 4. Substitute your lash curler with a teaspoon There's a very old trick that I always use, it's like the curling your lashes with a teaspoon. It's a little spoon, which is kind of hard to do by yourself. They're always very impressed when I do it for the first time, so that leaves an impression. With Jennifer [Lawrence], she's kind of open for—she knows her face, she's not very demanding and she doesn't have specific things that she wants. She will help choose and she'll say, 'I like that color, I like that shade,' but it's not that she has specific little tricks which she's really hooked on. With Bella [Hadid], her skin is flawless and she tells me where she likes to have her contouring and she knows her face better than anyone else, so I follow her in that. Courtesy of Dior 5. Don't be afraid to experiment I remember, in the '80s when I was young, I felt fantastic but five to 10 years later, I was like, 'I was high in those pictures! What the f*ck was I thinking?' And now I find them and the only thing I remember is, 'I know I felt great then, and I don't care now what I looked like'. And that's the same with makeup. I'm sure there are girls who will see themselves contour in five years and think, 'My god, what was I thinking?' and in twenty years they will say, 'My god, remember those years?' It's the moment. And at the end of the day, you just wipe it off, then next day you do something else.
