A panda cub took an interest in a vent on the door which leads to its enclosure\nWheee! The animal, from a breeding centre in China, climbed onto the door and tried to open it\nHanging there: The cub latched onto the door as a keeper came out from the enclosure\nThe video was posted by People's Daily Online to YouTube on January 16. It was originally released by iPanda , a popular website focussing on introducing pandas.\nThe clip was filmed at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.\nThe tiny panda took a great interest in a vent on the entrance and couldn't stop playing with it.\nAt first, the cub climbed onto two metal bars installed across the vent. A keeper happened to come out from the enclosure and the panda remained clinging onto the door as it swung open.\nAfter the keeper came out of the enclosure, the naughty panda still couldn't stop playing with the door as it tried to climb onto the vent again.\nAs the keeper tried to stop the cub from opening the door, the animal started climbing up the keeper's leg. However, it soon lost its balance and fell to the ground.\nTime to open the door, again: After the keeper closed the door, the cub tried to open it\nFailed effort: However the keeper used her hand to stop the panda from opening the entrance\nIPanda is a collaboration between the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the China Network Television.\nThe China Network Television has installed 28 cameras in five parts of the base in order to capture the daily life of these adorable animals, according to iPanda.\nBased in Chengdu in Sichuan Province, where most wild pandas originated, the centre has bred 243 cubs in the past 30 years, with 176 of them surviving.\nI love climbing: The cub then became interested in the keeper's right leg and climbed onto it\nOuch: The mischievous cub soon lost its balance and fell to the ground\nThe Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding has the world's largest artificial breeding population of captive giant pandas.\nIts effort in breeding pandas as well as re-introducing them to the wild have helped change the future of the once endangered animals.\nLast year, the black and white bear, a symbol of China, was shifted off the endangered species list by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nIUCN said in a report last September that the animal is now classified as a 'vulnerable' instead of 'endangered' species, reflecting its growing numbers in the wild in southern China.\nFUSHUN: THE NAUGHTIEST PANDA CUB IN THE WORLD Head first dive! Fushun rose to fame when he tumbled off the stage last September\nAmong all the panda cubs in the world, Fushun might be the naughtiest.\nThe six-month-old male panda, from China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, melted the world's heart last year after it had tumbled from a stage and face-planted to the ground.\nThe cub was being showcased to the public for the first time at two months old when he tried to escape from the stage.\nThe picture showing the exact moment when Fushun fell to the ground was selected by Reuters as one of the best pictures of 2016.\nOn January 20, the baby bear made news again after it had caused havoc for his keeper who was trying to present him to the public to welcome the Lunar New Year.\nWhile the other cubs sat relatively still in their keepers' arms, Fushun kept wiggling his body and waving his limbs.\nHis keeper, Mei Yan, had trouble carrying the mischievous bear, which weighed 10.2kg (22.5 pounds).", "external_links": ["http://en.ipanda.com/live/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdncNebbIR8", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:40:59.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
