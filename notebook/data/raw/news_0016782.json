(ABC Rural: Bronwyn Herbert) \n\"We are in this boom,\" Mr Brook said. \n\"Distilleries are popping up all over Australia and really starting to showcase and create an identity for our spirits. \n\"Native flavours play the biggest part in it.\" \nThe hum of farm machinery in the background makes it obvious it is still a working macadamia nut farm. \nAnd the macadamia — one of Australia's most commercialised native species — is not forgotten in Mr Brook's brew. \n\"We actually use macadamia in the gin, for us that gives us a very silky mouth feel,\" he said. \n\"For us it acts as a flavour carrier and brings the flavour of the native raspberries, the juniper and the coriander together and really just puts them in the limelight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:00:19.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
