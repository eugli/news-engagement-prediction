Sprewell left New York on bad terms with Dolan, however, after was sent to the Timberwolves as part of a four-team trade in the summer of 2003. Sprewell blamed Dolan for pushing him out of New York in no uncertain terms. \nDuring the first half of Spurs-Knicks, Sprewell opened up to ESPN's Israel Gutierrez about the unceremonious end to his Knicks career. \n\"When I left, I was not happy,\" Sprewell said. \"New York is like a second home for me. I love the fans here. The fans have embraced me. There's no place like the Garden to play in. Who wouldn't want to play in the Garden? I was definitely disappointed. I had fun in Minnesota, too. We had a good run there with KG (Kevin Garnett) and Sam (Cassell) and myself. It's just the nature of the beast when you're an NBA player. You just have to deal with it. I'm happy to be back now, though.\" \nMORE: LeBron, Wade and CP3 all come to Oakley's defense \nSprewell says a friend (Jonathan Supranowitz, Knicks vice president of public relations) stayed in contact with him and created an opportunity for him to come back to New York. The Knicks played a Sprewell highlight package at the game and showed him on the Jumbotron. Here's the video they just showed at MSG \"welcoming back\" Latrell Sprewell pic.twitter.com/DnXnsPHwmX — Tommy Beer (@TommyBeer) February 12, 2017 \n\"I'm at a loss for words, really. It's been so long since I've been back,\" Sprewell said. \"Just to have that warm welcome is very much appreciated. I can't say enough about the fanbase here and how they've supported me throughout my years here in New York. It's a great feeling.\" \nGutierrez also asked Sprewell about Oakley's confrontation with Garden security and arrest Wednesday. While Sprewell and Oakley never played for the Knicks at the same time, Sprewell was saddened by the incident and hopes it's something Oakley and the Knicks organization can fix. \n\"Obviously, it's a disappointing thing,\" Sprewell said. \"No one wants to see anything like that. Not just for New York, but just for the NBA family. I mean, it happened. Hopefully, it will be something that everybody can just somehow iron out and get past. I mean, just an unfortunate situation, obviously.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:24:51.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
