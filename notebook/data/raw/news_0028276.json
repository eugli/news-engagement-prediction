Water is seen running over the emergency spillway as well as the main spillway. Department of Water Resources \n​ The Bee: Say the top 30 feet of the emergency spillway does break off​,​ and it sends a pressure wave down the system​. That would raise concerns of levees failing in Oroville and other towns along the Feather River channel. ​Would it cause a big risk in Sacramento? \n​ Countryman: ​ It’s hard to say​, because there is a lot of volume in the floodplain, but once the levee burst​​ most of that water is going to be leaving the river and spreading across the land. With the Yolo Bypass and everything​, my gut tell tells me that Sacramento probably doesn’t have major concern. \nThe Bee: But Marysville, Oroville, Live Oak​? The Highway 70 corridor? \nCountryman: That’s gone. I’ll tell you right now that’s gone. If they lose that 30 feet that’s gone. \n​ The Bee: What happens tomorrow? \nCountryman: ​ You’ve got this dilemma: You’ve got a broken spillway that you don’t really want to be putting large flows down. But you don’t have any alternatives now. Now, you’ve got to put more water through it​, and you’re endangering (that structure). Tomorrow, when you wake up and we can get a good view of it​, you may see that those gates are in trouble. If they’re not – if they’re making this 100,000 cfs release (and) the gates are in a safe condition – then we’re in a pretty good position to ride it out. \nThe Bee: That means you can lean on the spillway full throttle? \nCountryman: Exactly. And the channels can handle it. They were afraid to open it up because they didn’t know the broken spillway could handle it. Now they’ve been forced to open it up, and tomorrow we’l​l​ find out if it worked.
