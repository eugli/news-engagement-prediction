REUTERS Zlatan Ibrahimovic has refused to commit himself to Manchester United for next season \nContract talks are expected to continue in the summer, but his future could hinge on two world-class strikers.Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 35, has exceeded expectations with 15 Premier League goals but is remaining coy about whether he will stay at the club.When asked if he had triggered the one-year extension clause in his United contract which currently expires this summer, he replied: \"Something like that. I have to score 100 goals!“The option is already fulfilled. But there's nothing done yet. From my side. We'll wait and see.
