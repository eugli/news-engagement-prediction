They even put out a tweet congratulating Patel. But unfortunately for everyone involved, the image they attached to the tweet was not of Dev Patel, but Star Wars Rogue One star Riz Ahmed. \nThe tweet was soon deleted, but the Internet is permanent. Several Twitter users grabbed screenshots of the goof-up, some even suggesting that this mistake hinted at underlying racism. Do “all brown people look the same?” asked Twitter user Simran Jeet Singh. Burberry just confused @RizMC for Dev Patel because all brown people look the same? This is why we need to diversify our media. pic.twitter.com/d4iIITHNdo ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:36:38.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
