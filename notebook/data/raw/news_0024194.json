Article continues below Former Barcelona chief reveals the one big problem Ibrahimovic and Messi had \nHowever, while Carlo Ancelotti's side are showing defensive solidity in their quest for league and European glory, Wenger's Gunners have conceded 28 times in 25 league outings. \nAnd it is their defending, Arsenal captain Per Mertesacker believes, that will have to improve if they are to stand a chance of returning from their last 16 tie against Bayern with a positive result. Defensive discipline \n“I think defensive discipline is something we have to put back in our minds because it’s something we need desperately,” said Mertesacker, per the London Evening Standard. \n“If you want to be at the top, you need discipline. We need to focus on that kind of game where we feel good defensively first, and then from there spread out and find out offensive power. \n\"You can’t do what we did against Watford, where we gifted them two goals, or what we did against Chelsea, where we lacked that bit of intensity at times. \n“The Bayern Munich tie gives us a real chance to do that again. That’s what we want to do, that’s why we play in the Champions League.” \nThe Gunners defensive difficulties were not helped by the knee injury Mertesacker suffered during pre-season, with the former Germany international hopeful of returning to the Arsenal squad sooner rather than later. Contract extension \nIt was previously reported that the 32-year-old would be allowed to leave the Emirates in the summer when his contract runs out, but earlier this month it was revealed that Arsenal are set to extend his deal. \nThe move appears to suggest they have realised how important the German is to the team, in a period where the club's leaky defense could be costly in their quest for silverware this campaign. \nBut if Arsenal are to claim a trophy in the form of the Champions League this season, they will have to end a run of six consecutive exits at the last 16 stages. \nAnd unfortunately for Wenger's men, two of those exits have come against their opponents Bayern, in 2013 and 2014, while they were hammered 5-1 at the Allianz Arena in the group stages last campaign. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
