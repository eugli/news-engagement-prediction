Then disaster struck. \nBrady attempted to hit Danny Amendola on a short pass over the middle, but Robert Alford -- who recovered a LeGarrette Blount fumble earlier in the game -- jumped the route and stunned the Patriots with the second-longest interception return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history. Tom Brady made a diving attempt at a tackle, but he was too late -- allowing Alford to stroll into the end zone and break open the Super Bowl. \nRichard Mackson Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports \nUSA TODAY Sports Eric Seals-USA TODAY Sports \nCopyright The Associated Press.
