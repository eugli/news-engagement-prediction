But it did alter blood cell counts associated with inflammatory and allergic reactions.\nThe team said THS toxins may stick to surfaces for weeks to months, during which time chemical mutations may render them even more harmful.\nTHS may therefore contain toxins similar to first- or second-hand smoking, as well as \"new toxic compounds generated from chemical transformations,\" the authors said.\n\"Our findings provide further evidence that THS exposure can have biological effects and supports nonsmoking policies as the best way to protect non-smokers from the health effects of tobacco-smoke exposure.\"", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ekVClAZV4zoqvXw4lybfWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzY4O2g9NTA0O2lsPXBsYW5l/http://media.zenfs.com/en_GB/News/AFP/44f9a4b34703cf1b19f1d386f4bc9cdaf2fe7e12.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:25:54.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
