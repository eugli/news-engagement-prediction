(PTI Photo) \nVK Sasikala’s elevation as the leader of AIADMK Legislative Party and the resignation of sitting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam has attracted sharp reactions from people across Tamil Nadu, as well as outside. Scores of them can’t digest Sasikala’s elevation as the state CM as they had not voted for her, but J Jayalalithaa, who died recently. Pannerselvam was appointed Tamil Nadu CM after a number of days of political uncertainty following the death of one of the most beloved Chief Ministers of the state. It has been argued that even Panneerselvam would be acceptable as the state’s CM as had fought the assembly elections, but not Sasikala, who has apparently taken control of entire AIADMK machinery after Jaya’s death. \nThe news of Sasikala’s elevation also evoked sharp reactions from Twitterati. Some even took to jokes to reflect on the sorry state of Tamil Nadu politics. Here we take a look at five tweets that also reflect the mood of Tamil Nadu right now.
