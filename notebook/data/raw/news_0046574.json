This week on Teen Mom 2 , Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin talked about getting back together, after nearly coming to blows in recent weeks over their divorce. Kail wasn't the only one bringing the drama with her ex though, as Jenelle Evans, Leah Messer, and Chelsea (Houska) DeBoer all had their own struggles too. \nIt seems like it's been forever since Jenelle and Nathan Griffith broke up, and even though she's clearly moved on with David Eason (they even have a baby together), Nate still can't seem to let it go. It seems like every week he's bragging to his buddies about how much Jenelle wants to get back together with him. \nWe're thinking no, especially considering that Jenelle found out about his arrest for domestic violence against Jessica Henry, the girl he cheated on Jenelle with. Jenelle talked her lawyer about reopening her child custody case with him over Kaiser, and honestly, it sounds like a good idea to us. \nMore from CafeMom: 16 Times the 'Teen Mom' Kids Were #Twinning With Their Dads \nOver in Souix Falls, Cole DeBoer made our hearts melt by building a crib for his new baby with Cheslea. We're not talking about assembling something from a box either, the guy actually carpentered the the thing himself. He also showed off what an amazing stepdad he is to Aubree too, by celebrating her birthday with her, and making sure she had an amazing day. \nMeanwhile, Aubree's bio dad Adam Lind couldn't be bothered to even call ehr and sing happy birthday. Chelsea's ex has been complaining quite a bit (both on and off the show) about MTV's selective editing, but not contacting your kid on her birthday is just deplorable, dude. \nMore from CafeMom: Chelsea DeBoer Is the Subject of a Nasty Rumor Involving Adam Lind \nLeah Messer got irritated by Jeremy Calvert, because they couldn't seem to nail down a time to get together once he got back from a months-long work assignment. Leah's grandma encouraged her to confront him, but ultimately, she just rolled with it, and the look on Addie's surprised face when she saw her daddy was absolutely precious. \nAt least her co-parenting relationship with Corey Simms seems to be going really well. The two met at the hospital for their twin daughters to have some medical tests done relating to Ali's muscular dystrophy, and they got along just fine. Major yay for Leah having at least one non-stressful relationship in her life! \nMore from CafeMom: Kailyn Lowry Is Deemed a Bad Mom for Wanting to Go on a Book Tour \nThen there was the whole thing with Kail and Javi, which was basically the last thing we expected. Kail went on a trip to Hawaii with a friend sans MTV cameras, and came back with a new lease on life. To the point where she and Javi were able to have a heart-to-heart conversation off-camera, and later when they were filming, Kail mentioned getting back together to him. \nHe seemed sort of confused by it, and said that he was still wanting to move forward with the divorce, and they both awkwardly brushed it under the rug. Outside, the producers asked Javi what was up, and he said that he had just gone over to get his mail several hours earlier, and Kail had started crying, and they talked. \nAfter Javi left, the producer asked Kail if what Javi jad said was true, and she said she absolutely did not cry, and she would not be discussing it on camera, because she wanted to keep as much as her divorce from Javi off TV as possible. Well then maybe she shouldn't talk about reconciling with him on camera then ... just an idea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:58:49.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
