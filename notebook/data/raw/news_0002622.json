This aircraft will fly until sunset. Once this search is complete, the search will be suspended,” Jaffrey Janzszen of the U.S. Coast Guard said. “The decision to suspend the search is very difficult and it’s not made lightly.\n“Our hearts go out to Mr. Stewart’s family, especially his parents.”\nRob Stewart, 37, was diving near Alligator Reef in Islamorada, Florida on Tuesday afternoon with two other people. A colleague he was diving with collapsed when they surfaced and the group rushed to help him. Stewart reportedly signalled he was fine but subsequently vanished and hasn’t been seen since.\n“There are a lot of variables that go into how long someone can survive in the water. Everything from water temperature to wave heights to experience of the person in the water and athletic ability,” U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson Eric Woodall told CP24 on Friday morning.\nA U.S. Coast Guard vessel searched through the night on Thursday for Stewart and an aerial search was conducted with the assistance of a U.S. Navy helicopter today.\nWoodfall told CP24 earlier Friday that crews had searched a 3,948 square mile area for Stewart.\nHowever Stewart’s family said they would continue to search for him.\nFriends and family have spearheaded a volunteer search effort after a Go Fund Me campaign raised more than $150,000 for their efforts.\nTyler MacLeod, who organized the campaign, told CP24 Thursday night that they are struggling to find people and equipment that can help search in the dark.\n“They’re doing everything they can with what they have,” he said. “Friends of Rob have gone out there, rented a boat with night goggles. Anyone who can help us, we have money, we can pay. We need boats with night vision capabilities. We’ve been able to flood the efforts during the day but it’s at night where we are struggling.”\nStewart is best known for his 2006 documentary “Sharkwater.”\nFriends and family have said that he was in Florida shooting a sequel to that film.\nRelated Stories Search for Toronto filmmaker who disappeared scuba diving in Florida to continue through night Friends of missing Toronto filmmaker say more night equipment needed for search", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:32:14.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
