PUBLISHED: 07:04, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 07:21, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 CHRIS MURPHY Cowan repeatedly had sex with two of her male pupils \nLaura Cowan, 37, seduced the pair by sending them texts. \nShe repeatedly romped with one of them in a motel and her car. \nSessions with the other pupils took place a couple of months later in her classroom and motor. CHRIS MURPHY Cowan was a teacher at Tipton High School in Oklahoma \nA judge handed Cowan two 15-year prison terms on two counts of second degree rape. \nBut she will serve only 12 months behind bars after 14 years of each concurrent sentence were suspended. \nCowan must also register as a sex offender for life. \nThe charges were originally dropped after the 18-year-old pupils twice failed to turn up in court. The boys were not children but were adult men Lawyer Ken Sue Doerfe \nThey were re-filed six weeks later after they were subpoenaed. Cowan had sex with the youths in early 2014 while teaching at Tipton High School, Oklahoma. \nCourt files said: \"She admitted having sex in her classroom with a high school pupil. \n\"Cowan also described having sex with (the same pupil) in her car, in the country outside of Tipton, during spring break 2014.\" CHRIS MURPHY Cowan will only spend 12 months of the sentence behind bars \nShe had already had slept with another pupil in January 2014 in a motel and her car. \n\"Both pupils verified that they did have sex with Cowan when they were pupils at Tipton High School,\" said the documents. \nProsecutor Deanna Hansell had called for Cowan to serve at least five years in jail. \nThe relationships started out with text messages and escalated to intercourse, said Hansell. \nAnd Cowan's actions were \"poor decision-making\" by someone in a position of authority. \nCowan's lawyer Ken Sue Doerfel said her client had voluntarily given up her teaching licence and asked for probation rather than prison. \n\"The boys were not children but were adult men who were 18-years-old when it happened,\" she said. \nCowan, who pleaded no contest to the charges at an earlier hearing, will serve her sentence in Tillman County Jail. \nDistrict Court Judge Norman Russell ordered her to be put on 12 months supervision after her release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:35:18.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
