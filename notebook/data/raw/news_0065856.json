This video shows just how silly it can all get, including things like coffee cups (fine), a bag of sweets (a bit odd but, okay) and a pizza box (whatevs). However, the video ends with the player as a banana, passing through an airlock into space. \nLet's just enjoy that last moment again. This is gaming in 2017. \nIt's not all bananas and toilet rolls at least, as Arkane explains, \"you’ll start small – a coffee mug, a teapot, a lamp, a banana – but as you level up this ability, you’ll soon be able to mimic more complex objects, including an impressive array of security turrets and Operator robots.\" \nYou can see that last bit when the player avoids a turret by becoming one: \nThat defintely looks cool, but I have no idea how the game's going to hold itself together with that kind of power in the player's hands. It looks like you can become any physics object. Combined with things such as the platform-creating Glue Gun and all the other abilities it looks like a heady mess. In a good way. You can read why we think Prey is basically BioShock in space here . \nSeen something newsworthy?
