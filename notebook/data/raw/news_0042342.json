Either a blacktip or spinner shark washed ashore New Smyrna Beach Inlet over President's Day weekend without a tail. (Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue) Jason Ruiter over the President’s Day weekend, Volusia County officials said Monday.\nThe blacktip or spinner shark washed ashore about 10 a.m. with its tail and the lower part of its body missing. Officials said they think another predator chomped at the shark, but they didn’t know what it was. \n“There’s a lot of fish that wash up that have been bitten by something,” said Capt. Tamra Marris, spokeswoman for the county’s Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. \nVolusia County, home of New Smyrna Beach and Daytona Beach, had the largest number of unprovoked shark incidents in the state in 2016: 15, according to the University of Florida’s International Shark Attack File. \nAlso in 2016, Florida had the largest number of unprovoked shark attacks in the world, a report by the group stated. \nLast fall, sharks bit three surfers over the span of just a few hours in New Smyrna Beach. Experts said those attacks, which were not fatal, probably were from multiple sharks.
