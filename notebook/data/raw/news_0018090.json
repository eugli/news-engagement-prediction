Not his coach, not his father Chino Hills sophomore LaMelo Ball shoots for 92 points \nSophomore LaMelo Ball of Chino Hills scored 92 points Tuesday night in a 146-123 victory over visiting Los Osos. \nSophomore LaMelo Ball of Chino Hills scored 92 points Tuesday night in a 146-123 victory over visiting Los Osos. Eric Sondheimer is pretty extraordinary, so what did 15-year-old LaMelo Ball of Chino Hills do when he got home Tuesday night?\n“He took a shower, ate something and went to bed,” his father, LaVar Ball, said. \nA day after he scored 51 points in the first three quarters and then poured in 41 more in the fourth of a 146-123 victory over Los Osos, debate swirled over whether Ball’s accomplishment should be celebrated or criticized. \n“As a coach, if I see a player doing well, who am I to stop his shine?” Stephan Gilling, Chino Hills’ first-year coach said Wednesday morning. \nWith LiAngelo Ball, the team’s leading scorer, sidelined because of an ankle injury, younger brother LaMelo was asked to take on an additional scoring load. He took 61 shots. \nLos Osos Coach Dave Smith said his team tried everything to stop the onslaught, even triple-teaming Ball. But after the game he called it “a joke,” adding, “It goes against everything the CIF stands for.” \nOn Wednesday, Smith said, “I told Mr. Ball he has great sons. There’s no animosity on my part about the kids or the Ball family. My problem is what we have done as a society. What we have done as coaches to athletics. \n“It’s about integrity and sportsmanship. When only one kid shoots every shot but one in a quarter, that’s not right. That’s not, as coaches, what we’re supposed to do. \n“They have a chance to score a layup and they turn and pass the ball out so another teammate can score. That’s not good.” \nCheck out these videos of Chino Hills’ Ball Brothers — LaMelo, a sophomore who scored 92 points against Los Osos on Tuesday night ; LiAngelo, a senior who is normally the Huskies’ top scorer but was out with an injury during his little brother’s big game; and Lonzo, now a freshman standout at UCLA... \nCheck out these videos of Chino Hills’ Ball Brothers — LaMelo, a sophomore who scored 92 points against Los Osos on Tuesday night ; LiAngelo, a senior who is normally the Huskies’ top scorer but was out with an injury during his little brother’s big game; and Lonzo, now a freshman standout at UCLA... Read the story \nBall may have been particularly inspired because Chino Hills (26-1) was coming off its first loss of the season on Saturday night, when it had its 60-game winning streak come to an end in a 96-91 defeat to Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill. It was also senior night and players were dedicating the game to a Chino Hills student who is ill. \n“He was just hot, unbelievably hot,” Gilling said. \nLaVar Ball hinted that there might be similar breakout performances in the future. \"The bigger the stage, the better he likes to play … he's been scoring like this all his life,\" he said of his youngest boy. \nMiddle brother LiAngelo scored 72 points in a November game against Temecula Rancho Christian. Older brother Lonzo Ball had many big games for Chino before heading to UCLA, where he has become a projected top-three pick in the next NBA draft. \n“My boys treat this game as entertainment because that’s all it is,” LaVar Ball said. “We’re going to entertain until the clock hits zero. If you pay $8 for a ticket, we’re not going to give you $7.50. I’ve had my boys playing like that since they were babies.” \nLaVar said LaMelo scored more than 100 points as a 10-year-old against a junior varsity team. \n“I’ve been having him play 17-under youth ball since he was 11,” he said. “This is nothing. He could do it on a daily basis. He loves the game. … He’s only going to get better. He’s not trying to embarrass anybody. He only wants to be the best player, and he’s chasing his brothers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:12:27.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
