The queen of the jungle has landed herself a dream role on Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway , and the star can’t stop smiling about it. Talking about how it feels to reunite with the iconic I’m a Celeb presenters, Scarlett said: “It’s like a dream come true – working with Ant and Dec is unbelievable. They are my absolute heroes. Some of my favourite memories are being at home belly laughing with the family watching Saturday Night Takeway. ” And if the newly single presenter wasn’t starring on the show, she would most likely be staying at home to watch it with the rest of her famous Gogglebox family. “It’s one of those shows that I would stay in for. Me, my mum, dad and my sister would get a takeaway. Then maybe afterwards I’d meet my friends in the local.” Scarlett's presenting career has gone from strength to strength since she was crowned queen of the jungle \nScarlett, who sadly split from her boyfriend of a year, Luke Crodden, at the beginning of the month, has plenty to look forward to in the coming weeks. Along with signing up to Saturday Night Takeaway , the 26-year-old is set to present a new version of the popular '90s show Streetmate , which will see her take to the streets to play matchmaker to the public. Scarlett is also due to co-host a yet-to-be-named entertainment series with comedian, Alan Carr – phew! \nGALLERY: Celebrity break ups \nIt’s been non-stop for Scarlett since winning I’m a Celebrity back in December , something that the star still has to pinch herself about even now. She said of the proud moment: “When I won the jungle and sat on the throne. I never, ever thought that was something I would get to do. And they’re quite special seats as only 15 other people have sat in them.” \nGALLERY: Shocking celebrity transformations \nBack in January, Scarlett proved she was a natural after hosting the National Television Awards with Dermot O’Leary – not bad for her first ever presenting gig. To celebrate her TV success, Scarlett and her family went on a much-deserved holiday to Disneyland at the beginning of the year. Joined by her parents Mark and Betty and her ten-year-old sister, Ava, Scarlett revealed her excitement for their trip in a snap of herself where she is stood on a hotel bed holding a Minnie Mouse toy dressed as Princess Leia. She captioned the photo: \"Beyond excited ahhh.\" She later shared a photo of herself with her sister and dad outside Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty's Castle, writing: \"Moffatts living the dream\" along with a photo posing with Cinderella.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:28:39.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
