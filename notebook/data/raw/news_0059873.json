Read at your own risk! \nWes’ killer was revealed during the two-hour How to Get Away with Murder season finale — and you probably didn’t see that twist coming. \nWhile it looked like A.D.A. Todd Denver (Benito Martinez) had manufactured the house fire — getting mysterious hit man Dominic (Nicholas Gonzalez) to murder Wes (Alfred Enoch) and blow the place up — in a bid to finally take down Annalise (Viola Davis), it turns out he wasn’t working alone. In fact, he was working for — twist ! — Laurel’s (Karla Souza) father, Jorge Castillo (Esai Morales). What does this all mean? EW turned to executive producer Pete Nowalk to get the scoop on what’s next. (Read our postmortem with Karla Souza here .) \nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Laurel’s father is actually responsible for Wes’ death. Why? PETE NOWALK: That’s something I can’t answer, because that’s obviously something we’re going to have to find out next season. \nWas this your plan from the beginning? It was an option, yes. When we introduced him in the first half of the season, I knew there was a reason we were doing that. \nWas A.D.A. Denver working with Laurel’s father this whole time? We did see Denver meet with Dominic, who was called a family friend of the Castillos. A lot of these confusions are really just questions that we’re setting up for next season. That’s the point. We do know that there is some sort of connection, but obviously we didn’t tell you what that was. \nIs this part and parcel of Laurel’s father wanting to be back in her life? It’s so much more complicated than that. It’s really messy. We don’t really know that much about him. We’ve been hinting a lot about their past and all the mess the two of them have gotten into. One of my favorite things about the episode is really watching Laurel’s face when she runs into Dominic, because I think you can interpret that her mind is putting together a lot of pieces there, and those are pieces that we’ll put together for the audience next year. \nHow will Laurel feel about her father coming back in the picture? In this circumstance, whether she thinks he did it or whether she’s now wondering if he had something to do with it, I think she’s going to be really upset, to say the least. I think it could start some real family drama. \nYou teed up the possibility of Laurel weighing having an abortion. Will that be a big part of the storytelling next season? We’ll see. Not that much time has passed since she found out she was pregnant. Obviously, that is one of the options. What happened, whether she has the baby or not, we’ll figure out next season, but I did not think that Laurel would make a rushed decision. I think she’d take as much time as she needed, which is why we did not have any conclusion to that storyline this season. \nHow much will we be seeing Dominic next season? I really like [the actor]. Obviously, we owe the audience a lot of answers. Usually, we do that pretty early on in the season. So, why Dominic did this for Jorge and what his role is in the family, we’ll figure out. I expect, as long as he’s available to us, that we’ll get to see more of him. \nLaurel hesitated before saying he’s a family friend. Could there be something romantic in their past? Yes, I think all possibilities are there. I think she’s hesitating because she’s like, “This is a little convenient that he’s showing up here on this street right now.” I think Laurel is really smart, so her mind is immediately jumping to what the hell is going on here. \nLaurel was stopped before she could kill Charles, but will she still be targeting him next year? When Dominic showed up, everything changed. Maybe now she’s not so sure that the Mahoneys had anything to do with it. I do want to be clear: I don’t know whether Laurel was going to kill him or not. She obviously needed answers and I think was planning to threaten him. Who knows what would happen in the heat of the moment, but I don’t think Laurel is a stone-cold murderer. \nFor all intents and purposes, Connor did turn against Annalise. Can the rest of the Keating family ever trust him again? I think we’ll have to see what the reaction is, but I understand why Connor had to do that in the moment. I think he was scared and he gave away the phone, which, as far as he knew, had nothing on it. So I’m not sure how big of a betrayal that is. \nWhat kind of guilt does Annalise feel about Wes’ death? Is this her turning point to get back on the wagon? What I liked about her storyline in this last episode, and what I very much related to, is she’s trying to get better. Whether she can or not, that’s not as simple as you make a decision and you’re better. This was really, finally the start of her accepting the mess that she created from her trauma. There’s a lot more to dive into there, but what we saw in that last AA meeting was really a first step, it was a confession. \nOliver proposed to Connor, but we didn’t get an answer. What’s next for them? They’re growing closer and closer. Whether Connor is the marrying type, I very much understood why he didn’t answer right away. I also think he knows that the two of them have jumped into a lot of things that have bit them in the ass later, so there’s a big discussion that they need to have before they walk down the aisle. \nWhere will next season pick up? This feels like the first time you’ve ended a season without a murder, so what does that mean for next year’s storyline? Quite honestly, this is when we take a step back, breathe, and decide what we want to do. I have no idea basically, because I might decide we skip forward in time or I might decide we start with a murder. Obviously there are tons of bodies piling up, but I really didn’t want to do the same thing again this year in terms of just having another dead body. I don’t know, honestly. It’s kind of exciting. \nHow to Get Away with Murder is expected to return this fall on ABC.
