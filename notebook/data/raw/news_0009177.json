Kate Beckinsale had a hilarious response to an Instagram commenter who mistook her for Sarah Silverman 's mother on Saturday, February 4. PHOTOS: Celeb Look-Alikes! \nWhile out to dinner at Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, the Underworld actress, 43, shared a photo of herself with a group of A-list pals, including Molly Shannon , Lance Bass , JoAnna Garcia , Nick Swisher and Silverman, who confused one fan. \n\"That sarah is your daughter? Pretty like you @katebeckinsale,\" the Instagram user wrote. Rather than correcting the fan's mistake, Beckinsale humorously replied, \"Granddaughter. We are very proud of her.\" A photo posted by Kate Beckinsale (@katebeckinsale) on Feb 4, 2017 at 3:43am PST PHOTOS: Stars â€” They're Just Like Us! \nAs (most) fans know, Silverman, 46, is currently dating Beckinsale's ex-boyfriend Michael Sheen , which could explain why the commenter confused the comedian with the former couple's 18-year-old daughter, Lily. Despite their mutual ties to Sheen, Beckinsale and Silverman have recently become close friends.
