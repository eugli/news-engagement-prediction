Slot to Kentucky Links \nPrior to the start of the SEC Tournament following a 2013-14 regular season that saw Kentucky stumble to a disappointing 22-9 record, John Calipari implemented the now infamous 'Tweak'. \nFollowing 'The Tweak,' the Wildcats won seven of its next eight games during an unforgettable run to the NCAA title game. \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \nNow, after seeing his team lose three of its last four games, Calipari's at it again. \nDuring his weekly call-in show Monday night, Calipari said he gave his players Sunday off so he and his staff could install a 'reboot' to get his team going again. \n\"We rebooted today,\" Calipari said. \"I won't go into what the reboot was, but you'll see it.\" \nThe Wildcats (18-5, 8-2 SEC) turned in an uninspiring 88-66 loss at No. 23 Florida in Gainesville Saturday night, recording season lows in points (66) and assists (7) while being outrebounded by 25. \nCalipari said teams are making a concerted effort to keep the Cats out of transition and his team has to adjust. \n\"Teams are saying, 'you're not going to score in the first five seconds,' Calipari said. \"Now, you gotta play basketball.\" \nAfter averaging 13.5 fastbreak points per game in its first 19 games, Kentucky has averaged just 6.7 fastbreak points in its last four. \nCalipari said his team is hardly the only one in college basketball that is struggling. \n\"We have a talented group of kids who had a tough run who weren't ready to win those games,\" Calipari said. \"Everyone in college basketball has issues. Let's deal with ours better than everyone else.\" \n'The Tweak' worked wonders for Kentucky three years ago. Only time will tell if 'The Reboot' is as successful.
