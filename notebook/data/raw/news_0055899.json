(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nAllen Iverson had a nice brief chat with TMZ Sports recently. The Hall of Famer was hilariously honest, as he almost always is. \nFirst, Iverson was asked about the new 3-on-3 summer league called the BIG3 that he'll be participating in , and he said he'd like to play with Kobe Bryant and Shaq, though he added that he'll mostly be just involved with coaching. \nThen, he was asked if he'd ever coach in the NBA. This is where it gets good. Iverson responded: \n\"Hell nah, because I ain't coaching no motherf- that make more money than me. How the hell am I gonna tell them anything?\" \nFair enough. \n(Warning: As bleeped in the above quote, there is NSFW language in the video.) \nAnother amazing recent quote that Iverson gave recently was when he was asked why he never lifted weights when he played. Iverson just said he didn't lift weights when he played because \"that shit was too heavy.\" â€” Derek Bodner (@DerekBodnerNBA) December 17, 2016 \nAgain, fair enough.
