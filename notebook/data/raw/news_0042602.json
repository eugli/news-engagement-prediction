Credit: PA \nThousands of prison officers will receive a pay rise to help boost staffing numbers, the Government have announced. \nFrontline personnel at 31 jails across London and the South East will earn up to £5000 more under a £12 million package announced by Justice Secretary Liz Truss. \nThe move comes as staff levels at jails across the UK drop to a dangerous level amid surging levels of violence in prisons . \nThe Government hope the cash incentive will help prison officer recruitment and retention after figures released last week showed officer numbers fell again last year. \nThe new package, which is part of wide-ranging prison reforms, will see pay improved for guards at jails where recruitment has proved most difficult. \nNew recruits will can expect to receive starting salaries of up to £29,500 - a rise of £5,000. \nMs Truss said: \"Prison officers do a challenging and demanding job day in and day out. \n\"I want frontline staff to know that their work, experience and loyal service is valued. \n\"We also want to attract the best new talent into the service, ensuring we recruit and retain the leaders of the future.\" \nUnion chiefs have repeatedly warned of low morale across the service as assaults, self-harm and suicides in prisons rise to record levels. \nOn Thursday official figures revealed the number of personnel in key operational roles in public sector prisons in England and Wales fell by more than 300 to 17,888 last year. \nThe leaving rate of contracted staff has almost doubled since 2012/13.
