Inside North Korea: The pictures Kim Jong-un doesn't want you to see Tuesday, 13th December 2016 Since 2008, photographer Eric Lafforgue ventured to North Korea six times. Thanks to digital memory cards, he was able to save photos that was forbidden to take inside the segregated state 1 / 62 Eric Lafforgue/Exclusivepix Medi Taking pictures in the DMZ is easy, but if you come too close to the soldiers, they stop you \nDefector Jang Jin-sung, who was once poet laureate of North Korea, said the last leader Kim Jong-il hated China above all other countries. \nIn his memoir, Dear Leader, Mr Jang described how \"China, more than anyone else, proved to be the thorn in his [Kim Jong-il's] side.\" \nHe wrote: \"The US could easily be cast as the embodiment of imperialism… China, however, was supposed to be a socialist nation… \n\"[It was] forever tempting the isolated North Korean people with the fruits of reform and openness from over the border.\" \nForeign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang admitted China was interested in the death of Kim Jong-nam on Wednesday. \nAccording to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, he said his government was \"paying attention to reports\". \n\"We are very interested in the progress of the case,\" Mr Shuang told reporters at his briefing. \nTwo women and one man have been arrested over the death at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia.
