After 3 months I have had no issues. Because the drummer is quiet I can run the volume between 4 and 5. It takes all 4 pedals very well: Boss Phaser, Guyatone Funky Box(envelope filter), Ibanez TS9, and VOX wah. It sounds tighter and more focused than the Marshall Class5 and the Fender Blues Junior. It has a closed back sound that I have never heard before in a combo amp. I love it. And the triple stitched red-gold-green diamond pattern on the grill cloth is sweet. I purchased the AC4 2 years ago. At the time I had no rehearsal studio so I could only run the amp on 1/4 watt in my living room. 6 months later I was finally able to run it full bore and realized that it had a bad preamp tube. It came with Ruby's. I upgraded the 12AX7 to a Groove Tube Gold Series and have had no issues since. The stock power tube is still in it and sounds great. The stock speaker is still in it and sounds great also.If you collect low wattage tube amps this is a must have. And if you move it around a lot, get the padded cover for it - it's inexpensive and the gold embroiderd VOX logo looks amazing. VS Where's the CRUNCH???

Read complete review Features-3 I love the power selector so you can pick your volume but that is the only feature- everything else is vanilla. Quality-2.5 the first one I got didnt work but the second one did. It is a nice expensive looking amp though.Value-5 It is an all tube amp with a warm sound for $250Overall-3 Why, because while I wasn't expecting any Slayer-like overdrive I was at least expecting some 70's classic rock crunch but the overdrive is pretty tame so why have a tube amp if you are going to end up using a pedal on it anyways???Bottomline this is a great amp if you don't live past 8 on the volume knob because the 10 on this amp is an 8 on most others. I think I may send this one back as well and stick with my old Fender practice amp. Nice warm amp though.
