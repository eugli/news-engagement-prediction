According to Burt Ward , the original Robin, the stunts sent him to the hospital very early on. \nIn fact, he revealed that he had to visit the emergency room on the first day of shooting. \nWhen speaking to THR , Ward revealed that he showed up to his first day, and was expected to do his own stunts. While Adam West had a stunt double that looked like him, Ward did not. Since the resemblance wasn't there, Ward was told he had to do the stunts. \nThe first scene required the actor to jump into a moving car, and it didn't go so well. The car was going 55 MPH, and Ward said it caused a lot of pain. \"I instinctively threw my arm back and managed to catch my little finger around the gearshift knob, which pulled it right out of the joint, but it kept me in the car,\" says Ward. \"Even with the glove on, my hand was twice the size. I was in incredible pain.\" The hurt didn't stop there, as Ward was sent to the hospital four out the first five days he was on set. \nMORE THE BATMAN NEWS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:44:30.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
