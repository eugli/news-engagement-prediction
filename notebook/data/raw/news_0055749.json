Charles Lavine (D-Glen Cove), is the “nature and extraordinary quality of the school district, in terms of national and state recognition.” He adds that it assures that home values remain strong. \nJericho High School was ranked 45th in Newsweek’s annual list of the top 500 high schools in the country, which was released in August. Among Long Island schools, it trailed only Great Neck South High School (38th). Some students in Jericho attend Syosset High School, which was ranked 118th on the list. \n“Jericho is a community fiercely dedicated to public education,” Lavine says. “It is the model of what public education should be, at a time when public education nationally is being severely criticized.” \nWhile families may be drawn to Jericho by the school district, Dona Malter of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage says commuters are drawn by the proximity to major roadways and Manhattan and millennials are drawn by the area’s walkability. \nThe Long Island Expressway, Northern State Parkway and Jericho Turnpike all cut through Jericho. The commute to Manhattan can be as quick as 40 to 45 minutes from the nearby Hicksville or Syosset LIRR stations. \nJericho is comprised of four primary sections — East Birchwood, West Birchwood, White Birch and Oakwood/Princeton Park — and the dominant housing styles in the area are split-levels and high-ranches, Malter adds. Prices can range from around $500,000 to the multimillions of dollars. \nThe area is mostly developed, she says, but “there’s also a new generation of homes with the Postmodern larger houses that are being created in the community.” \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nJericho also boasts six condominium communities, the newest being Hamlet Estates, which was constructed in 2005, Malter says. \nJericho is home to The Milleridge Inn restaurant, the original building for which was constructed in the 1670s. Also in the area is Jericho Cider Mill, which produces fresh cider, pies and baked goods, and the Elias Hicks House, an Underground Railroad site. \nCONDOS Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff \nSALES PRICE \nBetween Jan. 1, 2016, and Feb. 15, 2017, there were 126 home sales with a median sale price of $811,000, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The low price for that period was $465,000 and the high was $1,780,000. During that time period a year earlier, there were 129 home sales with a median sale price of $735,000. The price range was $450,000 to $1,950,000. \nSCHOOLS \nMost students attend Jericho High School and some attend Syosset.
