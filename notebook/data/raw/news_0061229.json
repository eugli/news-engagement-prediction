During this phase, 52 seats will go to polls on February 27. Political slugfest has already begun over BJP President Amit Shah ’s controversial ‘KASAB’ remark. Shah was lambasted by Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for his with the BSP supremo going to the extent of calling the BJP chief a “terrorist”. In a stinging retaliation to the BJP president’s remark made, Mayawati said there “cannot be a bigger Kasab” than Shah. Hitting out at Shah, Akhilesh said, “BJP people have lost the battle on the ground and so their language has changed.” Shah had used the acronym ‘KASAB’, saying ‘Ka’ (in Hindi) stands for Congress , ‘Sa’ for Samajwadi Party and ‘Ba’ for BSP. He had said that till KASAB is laid to rest, UP will not have development.\nMeanwhile, the fourth phase of polling for 53 assembly constituencies of Uttar Pradesh had passed off amid stray incidents of violence, with an estimated over 61 per cent voter turnout.

In the 2012 Assebmly polls, Samajwadi Party had won 24, BSP 15, Congress six, BJP five and others three seats.\nHere are latest updates on Uttar Pradesh Elections-related events:\n10:54 am: Congress vice President Rahul Gandhi to address rallies in Mahasi in Bahraich, Rudhauli in Basti and Balrampur today.\n10:50 am: Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address an election rally in Gonda today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:27:43.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
