Rec Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images Claude Julien did not last long on the coaching market, as the Montreal Canadiens announced Tuesday afternoon that they have let go of head coach Michel Therrien and hired Julien. The former Bruins coach has been out of a job for only a week, and was highly theorized as a contender for the head coaching job of the Vegas Golden Knights. Instead, in a surprise turnabout, Julien is headed to Montreal for the second time in his career. Therrien coached the Canadiens from 2000 to 46 games into the 2002-03 season, but was fired after an 18-19-5 record to start the season. Hired as his replacement over 10 years ago? Julien, who went on to coach the Canadiens for two and a half seasons. General manager Marc Bergevin had this to say about the firing of Therrien and the hiring of Julien in a statement to NHL.com . \"I would like to sincerely thank Michel for his relentless work with the Montreal Canadiens over his eight seasons behind the bench, including the last five seasons when we worked together. The decision to remove Michel from his coaching duties was a difficult one because I have lots of respect for him. I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction. Claude Julien is an experienced and well respected coach with a good knowledge of the Montreal market. Claude has been very successful as an NHL coach and he won the Stanley Cup. Today we hired the best available coach, and one of the league's best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.‚Äù Therrien coached the Canadiens for the last four and a half seasons, leading Montreal to a 194-121-37 record and three playoff appearances, two of those as the first team in their division.
