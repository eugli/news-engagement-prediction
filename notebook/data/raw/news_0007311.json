But in the newest issue of Edge Magazine, North described how blurry the line between his real and digital selves has really become: \n\"They mapped my face for Uncharted 4 ,\" North said. \"Every wrinkle is mine, just over his bone structure. That’s my face , for god’s sakes.\" And I know what you're thinking: that's just facial motion capture, the industry has been doing it for years. But not like this they haven't. \nPreviously, Naughty Dog would capture an actor's movements by recording an actor's face, and then use the footage as reference for hand-animating the characters.

It really is the next best thing. \nRead more about the future of the game industry in the latest issue of Edge magazine, on sale now.
