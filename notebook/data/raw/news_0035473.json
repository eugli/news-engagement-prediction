Ali died on June 3, 2016, but there was never any doubt that Fight Night would live on.\n“There’s no question that without Muhammad Ali, something’s missing,” says Jimmy Walker, who founded the event in 1994. “But we just feel the importance of continuing the legacy.”\nThat’s why the 2017 event, slated for March 18, is being designed as a celebration of the champ’s life. Proceeds will benefit the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center at Barrow Neurological Institute, in addition to other charities.\nAli was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 1984, and a long, hard battle ensued. The fighter became a warrior against the debilitating disease, which included launching the center that bears his name in 1997.\nThe Ali mystique CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nThe stars come out to raise funds to benefit the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center at Barrow Neurological Institute during Celebrity Fight Night in Phoenix on Saturday, April 9, 2016. Cheryl Evans/azcentral.com \nEven though Ali became synonymous with Fight Night, he didn’t join the event until its third year. The first year, the big draws were boxer Michael Carbajal and Phoenix Suns Charles Barkley and Dan Majerle. Not too shabby, but let’s be real: It’s not Muhammad Ali.\n“Muhammad wanted to be part of the event,” Walker says about Fight Night, which has raised $127 million for charity.\nWith Ali attached, Celebrity Fight Night emerged as a powerful magnet for A-listers. Garth Brooks, Andrea Bocelli, Diana Ross, Celine Dion, Carrie Underwood and Robin Williams are among those who have made appearances.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn PHOTOS: Celebrity Fight Night 2016 in Phoenix   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

At this year's bash, Reba McEntire will return as emcee for the 11th year, while 16-time Grammy winner David Foster will serve as music director for the 18th time.\nFor McEntire, the idea of turning the night into a celebration of Ali makes perfect sense. And, she emphasizes, it will be uplifting.\n“Everyone in the past few years would be looking, waiting and watching to see if he was well enough to attend,” she says via email. “This year, we know he will be with us in spirit. So it will be very special, but not difficult. It’s going to be a huge memorial for him. So many are attending to pay tribute, to help his great cause continue, and others will be there to celebrate and reminisce.”\nAZCENTRAL\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\nA lasting legacy Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Celebrity Fight Night 2015 in Phoenix   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

He had a relationship with the boxer that went back to the early '70s. Now-defunct Sport magazine had named Ali its man of the year, and he was being honored on a TV special. Crystal, then an up-and-coming comic, was booked to do his impression of the champ\n“No one had really done him before,” Crystal says. “He just loved it, and that’s how it all started. That night, he said, ‘You’re my little brother,’ and that’s what he called me for the next 42 years.\"\nThe friendship never faded. Crystal became a regular presence at Celebrity Fight Night, always showing up to help out his honorary sibling. Most of the memories are joyous. He talks about how Ali, a member of the Islam faith, loved to do magic tricks, “but because of his religion, he would then explain the trick to you, because he wasn’t allowed to deceive you.”\nSome of Crystal's memories are more bittersweet. At the 2013 event, Ali was ill and having an off night.\nAt the 2013 Celebrity Fight Night, Muhammad Ali and his \"little brother\" Billy Crystal speak at the event. Ali's wife, Lonnie, accompanies him.   (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic) \n“He ended up having a fever and going to the hospital,” Crystal recalls. “But he wanted to see me. He was backstage, and he wasn’t feeling well. And when I came in, he was slumped down in his chair. When Lonnie (Ali’s wife) whispered to him I was there, he perked up and held my hand and looked at me. The words couldn’t come out; it was all in his eyes: I was still his little brother.\"\nIn the final years of his life, Ali didn't speak in public. That image of a silent champ resonates with Crystal, who was chosen to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.\n\"If you think about it, for the last 10 years or so, this is a man who didn't speak, but his quiet eloquence was pretty loud,\" he says. \"We have to remember that strength in spirit that he had, even while he was being plagued by this horrible illness. Our goal is to keep it going and to keep his good work going. That's what he would have wanted.\"\nReach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.
