From Farhan Akhtar to Mini Mathur, the stars recently took to Twitter to express their opinions about the same. \nThe film -- starring Konkona Sen Sharma and Ratna Pathak Shah -- chronicles the secret lives of four women of different ages in a small town in India as they search for different kinds of freedom. \nA copy of the CBFC letter to the film's producer Prakash Jha states: \"The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy about life. There are continuous sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused.\" \nDirector Alankrita Shrivastava, who is in Glasgow, where the film will be screened at Glasgow Film Festival, told IANS: \"I am not defeated, disheartened or disillusioned by the CBFC's refusal to certify 'Lipstick Under My Burkha'. I am more determined than ever before to ensure that 'Lipstick Under My Burkha' can be watched by Indian audiences.\" \n\"I will fight this out till the very end, and do whatever it takes because this is not about my film. The real issue is the systematic suppression of women's voices and the throttling of freedom of expression,\" added Shrivastava, who last helmed \"Turning 30!!!\". \nShrivastava said that \"as a woman and as a filmmaker no one can take away my voice\". She added: \"I believe the decision to refuse certification to our film is an assault on women's rights.\" \nThe film won the Spirit of Asia Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival and the Oxfam Award for Best Film on Gender Equality at the Mumbai Film Festival. It will be screened in Glasgow on Friday. At what point will the govt realise that they have appointed a buffoon as the CBFC chief? #lipstickundermyburkha \n— Kabir Khan (@kabirkhankk) February 24, 2017 #LipstickUnderMyBurkha doesn't get a censor certificate when it's been adjudged the best film on gender equality the world over. #darkages \n— Mini Mathur (@minimathur) February 24, 2017 Below is the reason CBFC listed for denying #LipstickUnderMyBurkha a release. Keep your barf bag ready.. pic.twitter.com/NFO42sRJIb \n— Farhan Akhtar (@FarOutAkhtar) February 23, 2017 I condemn the denial of #CensorCertificate to @prakashjha27 's film #LipstickUndermyBurkha .Its an act of arrogance by Pahalaj Nihalani. \n— Ashoke Pandit (@ashokepandit) February 24, 2017 \nIn recent times, the CBFC had refused a certificate to \"Haraamkhor\", but the makers later took the film to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal and got the green signal for release. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Friday, February 24, 2017 - 19:52 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:26:20.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
