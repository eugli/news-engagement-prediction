Gary Bobrovitz reports. Calgary iconic Symons Valley Ranch hit by spectacular fire \n“There will be a whole new development, including some high-density housing, some commercial and a village concept which will house the new Symons Valley Ranch farmers’ market as the central entity to this whole retail village,” market general manager Ken Aylesworth told Global News Friday. \nIf it goes ahead, the multimillion-dollar project would take about two years to build. \nREAD MORE: Burned-out vendors at Symons Valley market hope for a rebuild \nIn the meantime, a temporary farmers’ market will be set up in the current parking lot on site over the next few months. \nEarly plans call for an instant fabric structure – essentially a frame-enforced tent – to house the market. It would include lights, heating and washrooms. \nAylesworth said vendors are expected to move into the makeshift market by June. \nWatch below from Jan. 26: The historic Symons Valley Ranch continued to smolder 12 hours after a massive fire broke out. Firefighters will be on scene throughout the night battling hot spots. Kim Smith reports. \nThe fire on Jan. 26 destroyed the market and surrounding buildings. The Calgary Fire Department is still investigating the blaze. \nIt will take weeks, perhaps months, to determine the cause, according to CFD spokesperson Carol Henke. \nShe said materials gathered by fire investigators have been sent away to a lab for analysis. They are awaiting the results to determine if the fire was arson. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
