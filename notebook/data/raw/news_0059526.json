She was hospitalised for 26 days. Melissa How was riding a Metro train on Melbourne’s Frankston Line on August 8, 2015, when she was approached by an authorised officer who asked to see her Myki card. After finding it was valid, the officer accused the commuter of having her feet on the seats. He asked her for identification in order to write an on-the-spot fine. That’s when the situation deteriorated. Ms How disputed having her feet on the seats and refused to produce ID. She wanted an explanation but was placed under arrest instead. According to Ms How, she was “reasonably exercising” her rights. However, according to Metro, it is an offence to not comply with an officer’s request for identification. Ms How and Metro officers tell different stories about what happened next. According to the official charge sheet, seen by news.com.au, ticket inspectors observed Ms How with both feet firmly placed on the seat across from her. An officer also claimed Ms How pushed him in the chest, causing him to fall over, and repeatedly used offensive language towards him. CCTV from inside the train and on the train platform does not show Ms How pushing the officer. Ms How says the accusations made against her were all untrue, but admits she refused to produce ID. She says she was peacefully protesting an “unfair fine”, never had her feet on the seat and neither verbally or physically assaulted an officer. She says police were called from inside the carriage. While the ticket inspector did so, Ms How stood up and walked to the door, telling the officer she needed “fresh air” and was experiencing anxiety, a condition she was prone to, according to her doctors. She says she was stood over, tackled, placed on a seat on the platform and ignored when describing symptoms associated with a panic attack. Melbourne’s Metro system is where Melissa How says she was “intimidated” by ticket inspectors. Picture: Eugene Hyland Source: News Corp Australia INTRUSIVE RECOLLECTIONS AND NIGHTMARES “I was experiencing an anxiety attack, couldn’t breathe and needed to exit the train for fresh air to manage my escalating anxiety,” Ms How told news.com.au. “The four officers followed me. As I sat on the bench seat on the platform they crowded around me and the original officer stood over me so closely I could feel him against my knees and hear his breathing. “I used my mobile phone to text people and posted on Facebook about the situation. At one point, the main officer moved aside and I stood up and took a few steps forward to relieve myself from the human barricade they’d created around me, but they moved in quickly and tackled me, retrained me by my arms and lifted me off the ground, then placed me back on the bench seat.” Ms How says she expected police to help when they arrived. Within 30 minutes she was in the back of a police van experiencing what she describes as a panic attack and dissociation. The officers waited outside the van until she “broke”, she says. Medical reports from her treating psychiatrist, seen by news.com.au, suggest Ms How developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the ordeal, a condition which, in her case, involved “intrusive recollections” and “nightmares”. Ms How submitted a formal written complaint to Metro about the incident and the conduct of officers on August 25. After receiving her complaint, the officer involved wrote a statement that became the basis for four charges and legal proceedings, which were filed in August 2016, almost 12 months after the event. She was summonsed on charges until September 28 last year, the result of which caused an Acute Stress Reaction, resulting in hospitalisation, her doctors said. “I would observe that these events have had a marked and lasting detrimental impact on Ms How’s mental health,” Dr Judy Hope wrote. Ms How says officers were “intimidating, harassing and provocative”. She says she was “deeply hurt” by the way the situation was handled and “paid a very heavy price, including two hospitalisations ... and a diagnosis of PTSD”. Glenhuntly Station, south east of Melbourne, is where Melissa How was confronted by Metro officers. Source: News Limited CCTV SHOWS MOMENT THAT LED TO BREAKDOWN Ms How appeared in court earlier this month where she originally faced four charges. She argued that Metro’s own CCTV footage contradicted the officer’s statement. The prosecution admitted to having no hard evidence and two of the charges — one for assault and one for indecent language — were dropped. The hearing against Ms How proceeded on two lesser offences, including that she placed her feet on the seat and that she refused to produce ID. The wording was amended to read that she “placed feet on train other than floor” because she maintained in court she did not have her feet on the seat. “I had to accept responsibility for two minor charges for the legal proceedings to go away (but) the positive is it saves me more months on this legal rollercoaster and another several thousand in costs to lawyers and barristers.” She says she has “major grievances” with “the degree of power given to Metro officers”, “that a member of the public has no right to question a Metro officer” and “that Metro officers do not have the training to deal with a person that may be suffering from a mental condition ... is vulnerable ... or distressed”. It’s not the first time Victoria’s Metro officers were involved in a confrontation with a passenger. In October, 2014, ticket inspectors were filmed pinning down a private school boy at Windsor Station. Metro ticket inspectors pinned down a schoolboy in 2014. Picture: YouTube Source: YouTube Footage of the incident was filmed on mobile phones and posted to YouTube. It showed the boy, 15, kicking his legs and shouting “I’ve done jack s**t alright, f***ing get off me and let me stand up”. The officers said he “resisted arrest” and tried to escape a number of times. Witnesses said six to eight officers watched on as the arrest unfolded. The man who filmed the footage described the officers’ behaviour as “an absolutely disgusting use of force”. Metro promised to review the incident to determine if the officers acted appropriately. Issues relating to the behaviour of authorised officers climbed by 16 per cent between 2015 and 2016, according the Victorian Public Transport Ombudsman’s official annual report . “Consumers continue to express concern over the processes used by AOs and the nature of the AO role in enforcement,” Ombudsman Treasure Jennings said. “It’s an area I encourage transport operators to continue to review ... it seems incongruous to have this level of negativity in the community.” Metro spokesman Marcus Williams told news.com.au Authorised Officers are “trained in conflict resolution and techniques on how to deescalate a situation. “If a situation becomes unsafe, they call for police assistance. When an alleged offence has been detected, Authorised Officers report the matter and are entitled to verify a person’s name and address. If necessary, Authorised Officers are empowered to arrest a person.” Mr Williams said Metro is “not in a position to comment on the court case” involving Ms How and the Department of Transport. Melissa How wants Melbourne transit officers to be better trained at deescalating conflict.
