He placed the blame on the company, but the truth is consumers just stopped buying her products. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump It's NOT Nordstrom, it's the CONSUMERS that decided not to buy all your HYPOCRITICAL products. You lost by over 3 million! â€” Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 8, 2017 \nMany voted their distaste for the tacky brand and the many foreign-made Trump products with Shannon Coulterâ€™s #GrabYourWallet campaign. As of today, you can find the official, always-up-to-date #GrabYourWallet list over at https://t.co/2TQSA4DmH5 ðŸ‘› ðŸš« ðŸ’¥ â€” Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) November 27, 2016 \nEven more interesting and not surprising was the timing of his tweet. Well-spotted Kal Penn. White House schedule says his Daily Intelligence Briefing was at 10:30am. This was the tweet he sent at 10:51am. ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/THnW6IQ8G9 â€” Kal Penn (@kalpenn) February 8, 2017 \nI mean, I mess around on my iPhone when Iâ€™m watching the Food Network , but an intelligence briefing should require some attention! \nDonald Trump then pivoted from the topic, likely made aware that heâ€™s not supposed to be promoting Ivankaâ€™s brand. This is when it happened... Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nEasy D?! Nobody was going to let this slide. @realDonaldTrump EASY D, is that your new hip hop name?! â€” Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 8, 2017 @MrTommyCampbell Easy D, Spicy Spice, Big Trill Bannon... â€” Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 8, 2017 \"EASY D\" is the grade everyone will get when Betsy DeVos runs our education to the ground. â€” Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 8, 2017 @JordanUhl Easy D Bag â€” Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) February 8, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump Honey, you just have so much on your plate, and I think it makes sense to have somebody read over your tweets for you. â€” Bess Kalb (@bessbell) February 8, 2017 @realDonaldTrump Nicknaming DeVos \"EASY D\" is disgusting! â€” Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 8, 2017 @realDonaldTrump Why don't you do another Tweet slandering businesses because they won't line your daughter's pockets? â€” Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) February 8, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump easy d?
