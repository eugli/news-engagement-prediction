The scheduled meeting was nixed in the wake of a public back-and-forth between the two presidents over Trump’s proposed border wall and who would eventually pay for it. \nIf the excerpt of the call is to be believed, it would appear the call didn’t do much to improve the increasingly strained relationship between the two countries. \n“You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,” Trump told the Mexican prez. “You aren’t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it.” \nThe Mexican foreign relations department hit back against the report, denying that the call was contentious and that the “tone was constructive.” \nDuring a presidential debate in October , Trump said that we “have some bad hombres” and that “we’re going to get them out.” \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:34:36.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
