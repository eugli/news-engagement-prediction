Answer 2 \nThus Philip and Elizabeth are second cousins once removed through this relationship. Alexandra of Denmark and George I of Greece were siblings. Background \nMembers of the royalty, and especially those who are expected to rule, usually have married other members of royal families. Because royal families are, almost by definition, a very small percentage of the population, the chances of marrying a relative are greatly increased. Even if you add members of the nobility as eligible marriage partners, the available spouses are likely to have some common ancestors. \nQueen Victoria was related to her husband, Prince Albert , as first cousins and also third cousins once removed. Both Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, are descended from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as detailed above. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had a very fertile family tree , and many of their children, grandchilden, great-grandchildren -- and now even more generations -- married with other royal houses of Europe. It would have been difficult to find many royal families, by the time Elizabeth as a princess expected to inherit the throne, was looking for a husband. \nHenry VIII, an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, was married six times . All six of his wives could claim descent through Henry's ancestor, Edward I. Two of his wives were royal and the other four were from the English nobility. \nIn the Habsburg royal family, intermarriage among close relatives -- double first cousins, uncles with their nieces, for example -- was very common. Philip II of Spain, for instance, was married four times ; three of his wives were related closely to him by blood. The family tree of Sebastian of Portugal illustrates how intermarried the Habsburgs were: he had only four great-grandparents instead of the usual eight if there are no common ones, and he had only six great-great-grandparents instead of the usual 16. Manuel I of Portugal married women who were related to each other r; their descendants then intermarried. \nMore recently, many members of royal families -- including those expecting to inherit rulership -- have married partners who are not part of royalty or even the nobility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:48:45.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
