She says her saving grace was the agent’s realization that she is a celebrity. “ When I was flying to New York recently I was wearing a headscarf and I got stopped at the airport and was racially profiled for the first time in my life,” she told cohosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid . “[The agent] opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started apologizing but said, ’Take off your headscarf.'” \nLindsay agreed to remove her headdress, but the startling encounter stuck with her. “What scared me was, at that moment, how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock.” \nTwitter users immediately responded to Lindsay’s story and…let’s just say the headlines were less than sympathetic. @lindsaylohan how can u say u were profiled for wearing a headscarf and then defend Donald trump in the same breath? pic.twitter.com/Y5UysH70A3", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:15:04.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
