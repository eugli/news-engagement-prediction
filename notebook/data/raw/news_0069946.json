They show up fast and figure out the solution to the crisis at hand. Their commitment to serve is a model of community problem solving. \nIf only our local politicians were cut from the same cloth. \nTake the former Dallas mayors who ignored the challenges confronting the police and fire pension system and didn't even bother to make all of the appointments to the board when they were in office. These same former mayors now want us to believe they are the ones with the answers. \nThese former mayors, who call themselves Taxpayers for a Fair Pension, have joined hands with chambers of commerce to spend a fortune raised from big business cronies to run a direct mail and public relations campaign. \nThis campaign exists only to scare taxpayers just like you into agreeing to strip away the hard-earned pension savings of the police and firefighters who have spent lifetimes saving our lives and property. \nWhat this mayoral group is failing to disclose is that, while they were in office -- and right up to this day -- their actions and inactions crippled Dallas's ability to care for its heroes. These politicians gave away tens of millions of dollars in property tax abatements, tax increment financing, grants and loans to developers and rich corporations, with an often unmet promise of incredible return on the investment. \nThese are massive tax breaks that might not be fully clear to many taxpayers. This largesse was given to some of the same fat cats who now are funding efforts by the mayors to deprive our firefighters of basic retirement security. \nThese tax giveaways could fund care for our retired cops and firefighters. \nThere's no question our pension system faces challenges, but what's becoming increasingly clear is that one of those challenges is former politicians who never played it straight with taxpayers --and who still aren't. They should let the real problem solvers work with today's elected officials to find the right solution. Former mayors had their chance. \nFirefighters and police have made sacrifices and are willing to work with the community to make sure the concerns of all sides are addressed. They have been working with all stakeholders to find a solution in an effort to get a deal done. They have agreed to pay more into the pension fund and have cut benefits to save the taxpayers money. To this day, they still are at the table, working hard to find a solution to the situation we are all in. Yet still some want to villainize them. \nNo matter what solution is reached for the difficulties facing the police and fire pension system, the massive corporate tax giveaways will continue to undermine our city. \nIt's more than wrong that firefighters and police officers--who don't receive Social Security, who leave city employment sick or injured, who typically suffer from more medical issues than the general public, and who protected all of us in our times of greatest need--are being scapegoated to cover up how your tax dollars are being squandered. It's proof positive that old habits die hard--for politicians in or out of office. \nJim McDade is president of the Dallas Fire Fighters Association, IAFF Local 58.
