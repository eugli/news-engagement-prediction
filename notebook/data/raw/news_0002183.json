Sponsored 12 of David Emanuel’s most hilarious faces from Say Yes To The Dress \nThe British actor has helped turn the show into a ratings hit for the BBC but has now admitted that he has found it hard shooting for six months in the Caribbean away from his family. \nArdal will make his debut on Thursday February 2 episode but it is not yet known how Kris will make his departure. \n‘Death in Paradise has been an incredible experience, six months every year filming on a tropical island in the sunshine – what’s not to love!’ said Kris. \n‘Humphrey was socially awkward and clumsy but also brilliant, I’ll miss him but it’s time to hand over to someone new and spend more time with my family. I know Ardal will do a superb job and I just hope Humphrey gets a happy ending!’ \nArdal O’Hanlon said: ‘I am delighted to be joining Death in Paradise and exploring what’s made Mooney up and leave London for a life in the Caribbean. I’ve already had a taste of filming in Guadeloupe and can’t wait to get back.’ Kris and Sally Bretton in Death In Paradise (Picture: BBC) \nKris took over from Ben Miller who left the drama in 2014 when his character, DI Richard Poole was murdered. \nAs DI Humphrey Goodman, who arrived on the fictional paradise island of Saint Marie in the Caribbean to help the team cope with Poole’s death and also to find out who killed Poole, he won over viewers and helped to bring the show to all-time ratings high, with an 8.67 million viewers for the fifth series in 2016.
