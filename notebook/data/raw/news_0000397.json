It is not yet known if the pair will hold a joint press conference.\nIt will be the first time the two prime ministers have met, though they did have a “pretty lengthy” phone call in August, shortly after May took office, the spokeswoman said.\nMuch of the talk would be about general bilateral ties and trade, although May is expected to talk about Israel’s construction of settlements on Palestinian land.\n“Of course, alongside that they are going to want to talk about a range of security and international issues, including the Middle East process,” the spokeswoman said.\n“And yes, I would expect the prime minister to set out the government’s position that we think that the continued increases in settlement activity undermines trust. Our focus is on how do we make work a two-state solution with an Israel that is safe from terrorism and a Palestinian state that is viable and sovereign.”\nNetanyahu is due to visit Trump imminently in Washington, and is a loud champion of the new US president, not least his stated and controversial plan to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nEarlier this week Netanyahu praised Trump’s idea of constructing a wall along the US border with Mexico, tweeting:\nBenjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea 🇮🇱🇺🇸\nJanuary 28, 2017 Asked if May would bring up the issue of Trump, the prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “The priority for this bilateral is the bilateral relationship between the UK and Israel and how we work together on a range of shared challenges, not just looking at the Middle East peace process but also things that affect us both – the situation in Syria, the nuclear threat from Iran.\nIsrael president 'sorry for hurt' to Mexico over Netanyahu's border wall tweet Read more\n“But also one of the things they talked about on their call in August was how do we develop a freer trading relationship once the UK leaves the EU. With regard to the new US administration, obviously the prime minister has recently been.\n“Prime Minister Netanyahu was due to visit the following week, so it’s quite possible it will come up in that broader context. But it’s not the focus for the visit.”\nOn the US nuclear deal with Iran, recently criticised by Trump in tweets , the spokeswoman stressed that while it needed to be “carefully monitored” the UK still supported it.\n“She was very clear on this when she addressed the Republican retreat last week, and we believe it’s vitally important for regional security,” she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/825371795972825089", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827119326880813056"], "published": "2017-02-02T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:57:38.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
