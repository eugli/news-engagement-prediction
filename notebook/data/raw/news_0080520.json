And does the Square really need another Mitchell spawn?\n4) David and Leo’s hunt for their real dad (Neighbours)\nWill the twins ever find their real dad? (Photo: Channel 5) David and Leo Tanaka are no closer to discovering who their father is after blood tests proved homeless Bradley Satchwell was not the man they seek.\nWith the twins back to where they started, minus the cash bribe Bradley did a runner with, it waits to be seen what they’ll decide to do next.\nIs the identity of the twins dad someone we already know, and could paternity problems lead to a romance between Leo and a comforting Amy?\n5) Louis is the father of Leela’s baby (Hollyoaks)\nLeela and Louis (Photo: Lime Pictures)\nNo one has discovered that baby Daniel is the result of a one-night stand between Louis and Leela.

And could killer Cameron find out and seek revenge from behind bars?\n6) Aidan can't decide between Eva and Maria (Coronation Street)\nAidan just can't decide who he wants to be with Aidan has not only been unfaithful to Eva behind her back but has also promised Maria that his future is with her.\nTo make matters worse Eva has agreed to let young Liam live with her and Aidan while Maria spends time behind bars.\nIf Eva’s reaction to thinking Aidan was having an affair with Alya is anything to go by, then expect fireworks when the love rat finally has to face up to his cheating ways.\nHow will Eva react when the truth comes out about her two-timing boyfriend? Could Maria get an early prison release and force Aidan to choose between the ladies?\n7) Whitney and Mick’s secret snog (EastEnders)\nMick could replace Lee as the Carter man in Whitney's life (Photo: BBC)\nMick has taken advantage of wife Linda living in Watford by getting up close and personal to his son’s wife Whitney.\nFans are convinced that with Lee now out of the picture and with Whitney moving into the Queen Vic, a full-on affair is just around the corner .\nWriters on the show may have been forced into either scrapping or revving up this storyline after Danny Dyer’s shock break from filming.\nCould romance blossom between the pair now they’re under the same roof, and will Denise blow it all by telling someone about the hospital kiss she witnessed?\nRead More Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield offered roles in Hollyoaks 8) Joel and Bart killed Katy Fox (Hollyoaks)\nJoel and Bart are about to be discovered (Photo: Lime Pictures) Goldie’s ex Shane is in possession of a video that shows Joel and Bart providing Katy with the heroin that killed her.\nSuspicious dad Warren is closing the net and is about to put the pieces together to discover that his own son and Bart were to blame.\nWith the pressure mounting the pair could be quick to turn on each other to avoid getting the blame themselves.\nWill either of Joel or Bart take the blame to save the other one, and how will Warren react when he finds out who was responsible for his sister’s death?\n9) Michelle and Preston’s extra curricular activities (EastEnders)\nWill Michelle and Preston put the age gap aside? (Photo: BBC)\nEastEnders fans have been less than impressed with Michelle since she returned from Florida.\nIt was quickly discovered that the teacher had been sleeping with her student, 17-year-old Preston, and had been exiled by husband Tim and son Mark.\nMichelle looked set to ditch her schoolboy lover after catching him in bed with niece Bex, but moments later she was going up the stairs with him.\nHow will her family react when they discover the shocking truth behind her return, and who will protect her from Sharon when she finds out Preston has been living in her house?\n10) Phelan is a scheming murderer (Coronation Street)\nCould Andy return to see off Phelan?

Could Andy make a sensational return and get his final revenge?\n11) Psycho Emma is on the brink of a meltdown (Emmerdale)\nEmma really has lost the plot (Photo: ITV) Killer Emma has struggled to stay in control after she pushed husband James off a motorway bridge, causing a catastrophic car pile up below.\nEmmerdale fans called for Emma to be axed after she framed Kasim for the arson attack on a taxi in a bid to save her son Finn from prison.\nWill the guilt finally force the crazed murderer to confess to her crimes, or will her reckless acts of violence see her face time behind bars?\n12) Darcy is very much still alive (Hollyoaks)\nAdam is in for the shock of his life (Photo: Lime Pictures) In a shock twist Adam’s fiancé Darcy is set to rock up in the village and cause problems for the Donovans.\nEveryone believes Darcy is dead after vanishing during a boat trip with Adam, but his brother Liam, Tracey and Grace are hiding a huge secret about her disappearance.\nHow will Adam react to his girlfriend coming back from the dead, and where has she been for all this time?\n13) Shona has a mystery connection to Kylie (Coronation Street)\nShona sheds a tear at Kylie's grave (Photo: ITV) Coronation Street revealed there’s a strange link between Shona and the late Kylie when she visited the dead Platt’s grave .\nThe characters never met on screen but Shona is clearly connected in some way as she panicked when gobby Gemma insisted they’d met before.\nShe could be related to Kylie or her nasty ex Callum, who was murdered in the 2015 live episode.\nDo those tears at Kylie’s graveside prove Shona is related to her? Could the connection be more serious and link the Platts back to Callum or murderer Clayton?\n14) Fake Dee impersonating Toadie’s dead wife (Neighbours)\nWhat other secrets is Fake Dee hiding?
