And that's because when I do, I notice people stare at my legs and it makes me really uncomfortable. \nWhen I wear a tank top and shorts, somehow it seems as if I'm showing too much skin and kind of get creepy stares, but other girls can do it and get away with it. \nHow do you all do it without getting creepy stares from people. Am i being too self conscious? \nSarah A.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
