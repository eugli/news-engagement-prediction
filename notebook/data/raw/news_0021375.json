Snowfall rates exceeded 2 inches an hour, making travel almost impossible for a time.\nThere has been at least one fatality due to the storm after a man fell down stairs while shoveling in Manhattan.\nFreeman Ave is closed pic.twitter.com/RhiJNfwFXF\nâ€” Sandwich Police (@SandwichPD) February 9, 2017\nHeavy snow, strong winds and even lightning brought down trees across the region, contributing to widespread power outages.\nOver 55,000 people were without power in Massachusetts and Rhode Island on Thursday afternoon, local utilities reported. This included all of the electric customers living in Yarmouth, Chilmark and Aquinnah Massachusetts.\nNot only did the blizzard lead to major travel disruptions on the roads but also at airports all across the nation.\nMore than 4,000 flights were canceled across the United States on Thursday, almost all of them either flying out of or into the northeastern United States.\nOne flight headed from Atlanta to New York Cityâ€™s JFK airport had to turn around in the middle of the flight due to poor weather conditions in the New York City area.\nPeople across the region may continue to encounter travel issues even after the snow ends as frigid air moving in behind the storm can lead to a rapid freeze-up, resulting in slippery travel.\nA woman walks through a snow-covered path at Pier A Park, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017, in Hoboken, N.J. A powerful, fast-moving storm swept through the northeastern U.S. Thursday, making for a slippery morning commute and leaving some residents bracing for blizzard conditions.
