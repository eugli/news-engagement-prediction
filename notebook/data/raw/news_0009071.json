ADVERTISEMENT \nLaunched in 2015 as an all-India event, it has expanded its reach to talents worldwide who battle it out in cook-offs. \nBuensalida is busy perfecting her game. She says that each entrant is assigned only a limited work area, while cooking equipment and utensils are expected to be the most basic. \nIn the first round, contenders will prepare an omelet, chicken fricassee, and a recipe to be handed out on the day of the event. The second part is a black box challenge, where the students will create a dish from ingredients to be provided them. The third will cover desserts and a competitor’s own recipe. \nOnly students with the highest cumulative scores in the first three stages will advance to the finals. \nThe top 10 finalists will compete in the championship. \nAside from the title, the winner gets a $10,000 cash prize. \nIn last year’s Olympiad, a CSB student ranked 11th overall after the initial three segments. Daniella Germond of Niagara College, Canadian Food and Wine Institute won the title.
