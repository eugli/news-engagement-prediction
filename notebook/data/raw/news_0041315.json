Surrounded by blackened hills, some just 50 metres away, their livelihood was intact. \nThe couple's business, Cracroft Chase Vineyard, is on the northern edge of where wild fire ripped through Christchurch's Port Hills last week. EWAN SARGENT/FAIRFAX NZ \nWilma and Alessandro Laryn at Cracroft Chase winery in 2015. \nThe Laryns left their property on Wednesday night, fearing the worst. \nREAD MORE: \n\"We started seeing the red of the flames coming down the hill towards the [Christchurch] adventure park, [which] is just behind us,\" Wilma said. SUPPLIED/WILMA LARYN \nWilma and Alessandro Laryn hope to open Cracroft Chase Vineyard by next weekend. \n\"We had packed up the day before with our essentials and our most treasured items like family photos.\" \nAfter hearing the fire had spread into Victoria Park, on the other side of their property, they expected they would return to \"ruins\". \nBut it was a different story when they were afforded a brief trip through the cordon to their property on Thursday. SUPPLIED/WILMA LARYN \nAlessandro said the fire came to within 40 or 50 metres in some places. \n\"It was absolutely untouched, it was a piece of paradise,\" Wilma said. \n\"All the hills around were completely burned and it was wonderful greenery, luscious, at the bottom of the valley. It was really incredible.\" \nAlessandro Laryn said he thought the property was saved by its position in the valley. \nFirefighters had worked to contain the fire on the side of the Christchurch Adventure Park, and the fire had not spread down the Victoria Park side of the valley. \n\"If you look through the photos . . . you see that the fire was only 40 or 50 metres from our property.\" \nAs soon as the cordon lifted, the Laryns were planning to get back to their property and open for business again. \n\"Certainly from next weekend the cellar door will be open,\" Wilma said. - The Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:01:46.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
