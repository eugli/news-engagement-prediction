(Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images) \nPACIFIC PALISADES, Calif. – The PGA TOUR ends its West Coast swing this week at the Genesis Open, with historic   – “Hogan’s Alley” -- providing the latest backdrop for golf’s hottest players. \nHideki Matsuyama and Justin Thomas not only are 1 and 2, respectively, in the FedExCup standings, they’ve combined to win five of the last six tournaments in which both players have been entered. This week, they’ll be playing at least the first two rounds together, along with world No. 1 Jason Day. \nA total of 144 players will tee off Thursday at Riviera, with Bubba Watson as the defending champion. Jordan Spieth, fresh off his win last week at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, will be one of Watson’s playing partners, along with Bill Haas. \nGENESIS OPEN: Field | Tee Times | PGA TOUR LIVE \nPGA TOUR LIVE will broadcast from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern on Thursday and Friday.

FedExCup standings in parentheses for each player. THURSDAY \nPhil Mickelson (54), Sergio Garcia (88), Jim Furyk (117) . Garcia is in great form, as he comes off a win on the European Tour and has now posted five consecutive top-20 finishes. Mickelson finished 65th last week at Pebble Beach; it’s his worst non-missed cut result since the 2015 Deutsche Bank Championship. Furyk tied for 66th in his first start of the calendar year last week. \nTee time : 10:22 a.m. ET off 10th tee \nJustin Rose (17), Dustin Johnson (33), Adam Scott (96) . Scott has enjoyed success at Riviera, even if it wasn’t official – he won the 2005 event when it was shortened to 36 holes. But he did finish second last year. Johnson has six top-10s in nine starts here and comes off a third-place finish at Pebble Beach. Rose has just one top-10 in 10 trips to Riviera. \nTee time : 10:32 a.m. ET off 10th tee FRIDAY \nJordan Spieth (3), Bill Haas (28), Bubba Watson (158) . Last week’s winner at Pebble Beach comes to a course that he believes is better suited for his game. “Plays more to my strength, I think,” said Spieth, who tied for fourth two years ago here. Watson, of course, has won twice at Riviera but has played a limited schedule since last year’s FedExCup Playoffs. Haas is also a past winner here (in 2012). \nTee time : 10:32 a.m. ET off 10th tee \nHideki Matsuyama (1), Justin Thomas (2), Jason Day (75) . Not only are Matsuyama and Thomas the top two players in the FedExCup standings, they’ve won five of the first 10 TOUR events this season. This is the second tournament this year they’ve been in the same group; they played together in the first and final rounds of the SBS Tournament of Champions, in which Thomas won and Matsuyama finished second. Day, the world No. 1, is seeking his first win since last year’s PLAYERS Championship; he tied for fifth   \nTee time : 10:43 a.m. ET off 10th tee MORE FROM PGA TOUR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:37:26.465+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
