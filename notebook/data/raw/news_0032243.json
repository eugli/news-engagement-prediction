The child managed to slip out of the safety belt (Photo: AsiaWire) The child being rescued from the ride (Photo: AsiaWire) \nIt shows the boy as well as a number of older children seated on one side of the thrilling drop tower ride, which begins jerking upwards and downwards after park employees turn it on. \nThe mobile phone clip is filmed from the crowd, where the child’s parents are apparently also standing, and where the boy’s high-pitched cries and screams can be heard. \nMoments into the ride, however, the boy’s cries are echoed by the onlookers’ gasps as the child’s small body slips through the chair and begins sliding downwards into thin air. The toddler is handed back to his mother (Photo: AsiaWire) Read More \nFor several heart-stopping moments the boy dangles dangerously by his chest as the machine continues to rise and fall. \nThankfully, the operators stopped the machine shortly afterwards and the terrified child was helped to the ground. \nThere have so far been no confirmed reports of the location and date of the incident, and no names were mentioned in reports, but the scenes have drawn comparisons to those of just one week earlier, when a 14-year-old girl tragically died after being thrown from a ride at a Chinese theme park.
