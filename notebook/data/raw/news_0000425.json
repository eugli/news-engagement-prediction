By Kyle Mizokami Feb 3, 2017 Lockheed Martin, the company behind the F-22 Raptor, is in the process of repairing and upgrading the fifth-generation fighter's anti-radar skin coatings. The coatings, along with the design of the aircraft, work to create a tiny radar signature for the fighter jet. From the front, the F-22 allegedly has same radar signature as a marble . Unfortunately, those coatings wear off in time and need to be replaced. According to The National Interest, LockMart has just completed its Inlet Coating Repair (ICR) Speedline facility. The facility basically overhauls the stealthy skin coatings, replacing them with improved versions that should last longer and upgrade their anti-radar performance.

The production line is closed, and the 186 planes built are the only ones around. The fighter will serve at least another 20 years, perhaps until the Air Force's long range Penetrating Counter-Air fighter gets off the ground. Read more at The National Interest .
