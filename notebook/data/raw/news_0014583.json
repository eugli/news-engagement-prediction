To answer your ?s how I stay \"fit\" I run 5x a week on average 3 miles, I do NOT eat red meat never have. It's genetics OBVIOUSLY.' The lengthy caption continued: 'I never sit down from the time I get up til the time I go bed. If you think it will make you \"fat\" it will! MODERATION!! Everything in Moderation.' 'It's genetics OBVIOUSLY': Kim, who has repeatedly admitted to having Botox, breast implants, and a tummy tuck in the past, also added that her 'fit' bod is due to 'running' and 'no red meat' 'No I don't do weights I need t but, I went through the windshield of my car at 18 and I have a terrible neck so I'm working on simple easy exercises. I tend to strain my neck when I do any weights. Everyday is a new day.' While Kim certainly looks fabulous, she has repeatedly admitted to having Botox, breast implants, and a tummy tuck in the past. Back in May she again told E! News she has had work done and even added that she could have more procedures in the future. 'I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so,' Kim said. Pert derriere: The plastic surgery loving star has even had Sculptra fillers injected into her buttocks to remove cellulite Her breast augmentation and tummy tuck were even documented on her Bravo reality show, Don't Be Tardy. The outspoken beauty has only denied having a nose job. And as recent as 14 weeks ago, according to Instagram , she's even had Sculptra fillers injected into her buttocks to remove cellulite. She also gets lip fillers - as does her daughter Brielle. In September, Kim spoke out about Brielle getting lip injections during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. Family holiday: Four of Kim's six kids joined the former RHOA star and her husband Kroy Biermann on the luxurious beach vacation in Turks and Caicos. All was well until... Meanwhile, Kim's 'genetics' post comes soon after she revealed some beachside drama that occurred while she and her family were enjoying their Turks and Caicos holiday. The star, who was staying at the Amanyara luxury resort with her family, took to Snapchat to recall a heated discussion she had with the fellow beach-goer. Four of Kim's six kids joined the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star and her husband Kroy Biermann on the luxurious vacation and they all seemed to be having a good time on the beach. In the video Kim was seen loudly cheering on her kids - Brielle, 19, Ariana, 15, KJ, five, and Kash, four - as they participated in water sports. 'F***ing loosen up, lady!' Kim took to Snapchat to recall a heated discussion she had with the fellow beach-goer during their getaway But, apparently, a woman who was also on the beach didn't appreciate the enthusiastic displays. She recalled: 'This lady on the beach came up to me and said: 'Could you keep you and your kids quiet? It's a very quiet peaceful beach.' Kim's response to the complaint: 'B*tch, what? They're 4 and 5.' 'We've been nothing but respectful,' she continued. 'I told her: 'Well, why are you always sitting next to me? Move your f***ing chair to the other end of the beach!' ' Kim continued to explain how the argument escalated. 'I said: 'That's ok, b***h, because we're leaving.' She's like: 'I'm not asking you to leave.' I honestly told her: 'You might want to f***ing loosen up, lady,' ' she continued. 'This is a beach that a lot of people pay a lot of money to stay here and enjoy the beach and if you don't like it, f***ing go somewhere else. It's life.'
