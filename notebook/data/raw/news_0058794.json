The Oregon star hit a game-winning buzzer-beater to lift Oregon over Cal on Wednesday night. Itâ€™s his second buzzer-beater of the season. Brooks also hit a buzzer-beater on Dec. 28 to give UCLA its first loss. This win helps Oregon keep pace in the Pac-12 race with Arizona. The Ducks are now 25-4 overall and 14-2 in the conference. Brooks looks healthy after beginning the year with a foot injury, and Oregon is finally playing like a top-10 team.
