We are thankful to the Modi government,\" Sonowal told PTI here. \n\nWhile in 2016-17, the central government will pay Rs 948 crore, in 2017-18 it will pay Rs 2,844 crore and in 2018-19 will pay Rs 2,528 crore. This is in addition to the Rs 1,450 crore already received. \n\nThe Oil India Limited produces 3.2 million tonnes crude oil in Assam annually, while Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited produces 1.1 million tonnes crude oil every year in the state. \n\nThe OIL and the ONGC have been paying royalty to the central and the state governments in terms of statutory provisions of oilfields (Regulations and Development) Act 1948 and Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959. \n\nThe Petroleum Ministry on October 30, 2003 had directed upstream companies, including ONGC, to give discount in price on sale of crude oil to the Oil Marketing Companies. \n\nThe notional price of the crude oil produced by upstream companies is initially derived on the basis of the average international price and then discounts are fixed as decided by the central government.
