The terror group released photos of al-Harith and claimed his bombing led to several deaths. \nISIS’ report of the attack could not be independently verified. But al-Harith’s brother confirmed the authenticity of the images ISIS released, and said his kin “wasted his life.” \n“It is him, I can tell by his smile,” the brother, Leon Jameson, told the Times of London . \n“If it is true then I’ve lost a brother, so another family (member) gone.” \nReuters cited three Western security forces who said al-Harith, 50, was the suicide bomber. \nAl-Harith was born in Manchester as Ronald Fidler and changed his name after converting to Islam in the 1990s. \nHe was held at Guantanamo Bay for two years, without charges, over alleged links to Osama bin Laden and after authorities learned he visited a Taliban prison in Afghanistan. \nHe was one of four British detainees released in 2004 after a massive lobbying campaign from the United Kingdom government and some national media organizations.

(AP) \nAfter his release, al-Harith claimed he was tortured in the U.S. military prison, and he joined 16 other men in a lawsuit against the British government for allegedly being complicit in their abuse. \nThe group won a cash settlement in 2010, with al-Harith reportedly receiving about 1 million pounds, or $1.25 million. \nIt remains unclear when al-Harith may have joined ISIS. The British Foreign Office, which has not confirmed al-Harith’s involvement in the attack, said in a statement it is “extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals” in the countries where ISIS operates. \nDemocrats say Obama must 'deprive' Trump of using Guantanamo Bay \nThe news of al-Harith’s attack led to some British news outlets, particularly the Daily Mail, castigating former Prime Minister Tony Blair for overseeing the militant’s release. \nBlair issued a statement acknowledging he coordinated the release, but not the massive payout years later, and noted the immense public pressure back then to let al-Harith walk free. \n“The fact is that this was always a very difficult situation where any Government would have to balance proper concern for civil liberties with desire to protect our security, and we were likely to be attacked whatever course we took,” Blair wrote. \n“But those who demanded their release should not be allowed to get away with now telling us that it is a scandal that it happened.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:34:26.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
