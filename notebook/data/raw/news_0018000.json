If they are unsure, they will also have to state it,” he told a press conference, held to clarify the issue here yesterday. \nThe Muslim Consumers Association of Malaysia’s chief activist Datuk Nadzim Johan had suggested the logo. \n“Why make it difficult? It’s simple, just place a label to say that the products are animal derived,” Hamzah said. \nOver 2,000 paint brushes that were suspected to be made from pig bristles were seized recently in a nationwide crackdown. \nHamzah said enforcement officers were told to educate the traders instead of penalising them as the problem was due to manufacturers who did not provide the proper labelling before distributing the paint brushes to the traders. \nIt would be sufficient for traders to label the brushes with words “products made of animal bristles”, he added. \n“We don’t want enforcement officers to go to the extreme and make it look as though it is a big problem in the country.” \nHe expressed disappointment that the paint brush issue had been turned into a racial and religious controversy. \n“I am aware that there are groups or NGOs who will use this to split the people and blame the Government,” he added. \nHe also said it was not necessary to have a separate halal label for non-food products, as suggested by Nadzim. \nWhile acknowledging that the halal logo was a must for food products, Hamzah said it was not a requirement for non-food products. \nMalaysia Metal Wholesalers Association chairman Low Cheng Ho, who was present at the press conference, said traders would be informed to label their products accordingly. \n“If they don’t do it, then action should be taken against them,” he said. \nThe others who were at the conference were Federation of Malaysia Hardware, Machinery and Building Materials Associations president Loh Foo, SME Association of Malaysia president Datuk Michael Kang Hua Keong, Malaysian Gifts and Premium Association president Alan Ong Yeow Fooi and Federation of Sundry Goods and Merchants Associations president Hong Chee Meng.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:30:11.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
