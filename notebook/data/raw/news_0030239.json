This has led to a rise in popularity of politicians such as France’s Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front Party, who is a harsh critic of France’s immigration policies and is in the running to be president of France. \nPresident Donald Trump has also been a critic of what he sees as lax immigration policies in the U.S., issuing a travel ban blocking travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. That order is currently being challenged in federal court. \nAccording to the Times of Israel, Syria has produced 4.8 million refugees. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Thursday that terrorists are “definitely” a part of the general refugee population. \nSyria’s conflict, in addition to displacing nearly five million people, has killed more than 310,000 people since it began with anti-government protests in March 2011. \nGuterres said Sunday “we will never be successful in fighting terrorism in Syria if an inclusive political solution is not found for the Syrian people.” \nUN-sponsored peace talks are scheduled for February 20 in Geneva.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:20:58.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
