He acknowledged he's prefer a United win at Wembley as it would assist his team. \nShould United win the EFL Cup and finish in the top five, or United and one of the current top four win the FA Cup, a seventh placed finish in the Premier League will secure European qualification. \n“It is true you need help from which team will win the EFL Cup or the FA Cup,” said Koeman. Is winning the EFL Cup a blessing or a curse? A glance over the past 20 winners \n“In that way we hope United will win at weekend and one of biggest clubs wins the FA Cup, because then it's possible seventh in the table can play a qualification for the Europa League.” \nK oeman believes European qualification can impact on the standard of players it is possible to lure at the end of the season. \n“Yes it is factor because players like to be part of Europe, and like to be part of the Champions League,” said Koeman. \n“That is the best for football players. The first step is to be part of Europe even if it is being part of a difficult Europa League on Thursday or qualification really soon in the pre-season. We would like to do it and be part of it because Europe is the next step. Southampton are hoping to upset the odds on Sunday Credit: afp \n\"Some players maybe like to see how we progressed in Everton for the future. You will always fight against big clubs with more reputation and with more Champions League competition. But I think we are in a good way to get what we want in the team and for next season.” \nW ith Arsenal and Barcelona among several clubs expected to be considering a managerial change this summer, Koeman’s name continue to be linked with high profile jobs. Koeman is not looking beyond his current Everton contract Credit: rex \nH e said his only focus at the moment is Everton, although he has no intention of committing beyond his current three-year deal at this stage. \n\"Ok. Links. That's always what happens, but you don't sign a new contract in your first season if you have three seasons of contract,” said Koeman. \n“No, no let's wait and see what happens in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:52:46.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
