Cavan Sieczkowski Deputy Director, News & Analytics Suzanne Plunkett / Reuters \nLindsay Lohan thinks its time for people to support President Donald Trump . \nThe 30-year-old sat down with the Daily Mail for a Facebook Live interview , and broached the subject of the new president last week. \n‚ÄúI think always in the public eye you‚Äôre gonna be scrutinized, and he is the president. We have to join him. If you can‚Äôt beat him, join him,‚Äù she said, before saying that she hopes he will ‚Äúbroaden his ideas‚Äù when it comes to refugees. \n‚ÄúYou know, I think it would be a positive thing for America to show their care and support, and for him to experience what it‚Äôs like for these people ... experience how giving Turkey has been to the refugees and how many they have welcomed in.‚Äù \nThe ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù star has been meeting with Syrian refugees in Turkey as the ambassador for German energy drink YNDA GmbH, which was donating money as well as cans of the beverage, according to CNN. \nLohan says she has been studying the Quran and was worried about coming back to the United States , seemingly because of the current political climate after the executive order against travel by people in Muslim-majority countries that Trump signed last month. \n‚ÄúI was scared to come here with everything going on because of my personal beliefs,‚Äù she said. \nTrump and Lohan shared headlines back in October when audio from a 2004 Howard Stern interview surfaced . In it, Trump states that ‚Äúdeeply troubled women‚Äù are ‚Äúbest in bed‚Äù while discussing the actress. At the time, Lohan responded by saying she was focused on other things. ‚Äî andrew kaczynski ü§î (@KFILE) October 14, 2016 Also on HuffPost: Lindsay Lohan Throughout the Years Lindsay Lohan Throughout the Years 1 of 27 Lindsay Lohan at the premiere of The Parent Trap at age 11.
