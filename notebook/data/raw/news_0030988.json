Normadiah Ahmad, the mother of Muhammad Syahidin Zainudin, said she trembled upon reading the messages at 9am on Sunday morning. The 27-year-old had died less than an hour ago earlier in a car accident involving a trailer and two motorcycles along Jalan Gadong-LBJ in Nilai, Seremban. \"I quickly called one of those who left a message to verify the news. The friend said my son was involved in an accident and had passed away,\" said Normadiah at Hospital Tuanku Ja'afar. According to Nilai OCPD Supt Zaidino Zaludin, the driver of the trailer lost control of his vehicle and veered into the opposite lane before crashing into Muhammad Syahidin and another motorcycle. Muhammad Syahidin was dragged 30m by the trailer and died at the scene. The rider and pillion rider of the other motorcycle and the trailer driver sustained serious injuries. \n> Actor Melvin Sia denies he has become very demanding Taiwan-based Malaysian actor Melvin Sia denies that he has become very demanding since achieving fame in Taiwan.
