Dan Kitwood via Getty Images Jeremy Corbyn was on the receiving end of a severe bruising \nMost dramatically, Clive Lewis resigned from the Shadow Cabinet , saying “in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent”. \nAfter the vote, Corbyn attempted to rally his remaining troops with a stirring tweet and call to arms. Real fight starts now. Over next two years Labour will use every opportunity to ensure Brexit protects jobs, living standards & the economy. — Jeremy Corbyn MP (@jeremycorbyn) February 8, 2017 \nUnfortunately, Corbyn hasn’t had a great track record in fighting Brexit. \nDuring the referendum campaign last year the Labour leader was heavily criticised for failing to make an adequate case for his party’s Remain position with claims close allies “sabotaged” pro-EU speeches and appearances. @jeremycorbyn You had your chance to start the fight. Instead you disillusioned thousands of young voters and didn't represent your members. \nAs a result, what should have been a crushing blow to the Tories triggered a Labour crisis that saw mass resignations and a vote of no confidence in Corbyn. \nAdded to this, Labour failed to secure any amendments to the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill passed on Wednesday night. \nEvidently, no one has forgotten all this, not least SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon. How? You've just handed the Tories a blank cheque. You didn't win a single concession but still voted for the Bill. Pathetic. https://t.co/kDje2GLAey — Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) February 8, 2017 @NicolaSturgeon Hi Nicola, can we annex our city onto Scotland and have another Indy ref please? I'd be most grateful.
