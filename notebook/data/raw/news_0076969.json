Last year it beheaded two Canadians. Jurgen Kantner Credit: AFP/Getty Images \nE arlier this month, the United Nations warned that Southeast Asia faced an upsurge in terrorism this year as the region had no plan to counter returning fighters from Syria and Iraq. \nAbout 100 Filipinos are believed to have joined Isil in the Middle East, along with a similar number of Malaysians and over 500 Indonesians. \n“Daesh [Isil] has shown great interest in this region. In June last year, a propaganda video instructed their supporters to focus on Southeast Asia, telling them to join their regional branch in the Philippines,” wrote Jeremy Douglas, regional chief for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \n“Now, as Daesh's territorial control in the Middle East diminishes, their need to disperse and move elsewhere is becoming a reality,” he wrote in the Bangkok Post, along with UNODC counter-terrorism expert, Joseph Gyte. \n“As a result, it is predicted that many foreign terrorist fighters from Southeast Asia now in the Middle East - there are believed to be more than 1,000 - will return home to continue their campaign and potentially declare a caliphate.” \nTom Sanderson, director of transnational threats at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed that the region faced real danger. \n“Even if 10 per cent return you have roughly 80 or 100 individuals who have tremendous confidence, skills, networks, credibility and likely funding,” he said. \nNo target would be off the table, he warned. “I would be concerned about hotels, tourism, police forces, Sufis, Shia, Muslim civic organisations.” \nKantner’s murder chimes with fears that Asian militants may step up their attacks against westerners and perceived western targets. \nFollowing the release of the video the Philippine government issued a statement condemning the “barbaric” killing of Kantner, whose body has not been recovered. \n“Up to the last moment, many sectors, including the armed forces of the Philippines exhausted all efforts to save his life,” said Jesus Dureza, presidential peace advisor. “We all tried our best but to no avail.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:26:36.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
