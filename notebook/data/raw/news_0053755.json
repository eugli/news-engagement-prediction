Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is the chilling moment an abusive boyfriend who battered his partner to death with his fists confessed to police that he 'just lost it'. \nJordan Matthews, 24, beat and abused student Xixi Bi for months before mounting a final \"relentless and remorseless\" fatal attack on the defenceless 24-year-old. \nA harrowing police interview shows hollow-faced Matthews says he is 'half responsible' for the murder of the pretty student and claiming the row was sparked by cigarettes. \nThe abusive thug, can be seen looking down at the ground as he says he dragged his girlfriend on the floor, threw her into a cabinet before punching her 'really, really hard' in the stomach.

Matthews, who has been jailed for life, looked away from police as talked about savagely punching and throwing his girlfriend around their home (Photo: Police handout) Pretty Xixi Bi suffered 41 injuries after she was set upon by thug Matthews (Photo: WNS) \n\"She said something and I just lost it. \n\" I instantly punched her really really hard in the solar plex area. \n\"She instantly dropped to the floor. I held her up with both her hands in front under her arms. \n\"I apologised to her and after that we sat down and she had a little bit of water \n\"She was shaking.\" \nIt was later heard in court the paranoid pub chef struck dozens of blows to Miss Bi, after seeing what he mistakenly believed to be a message from dating app Tinder on her phone. Jordan Matthews & Xixi Bi had been together since April 2015 (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nMiss Bi, who moved to the UK from China to study aged 15, suffered 41 injuries in the savage and prolonged attack, including massive bruising and a broken jaw and ribs. \nStudent murdered girlfriend during Valentine's Day 'rough sex' before taking pictures of body on blood-soaked bed \nThe attack started at 1.30am on August 19 last year at their flat in Llandaff, Cardiff and at 8.30am Miss Bi collapsed due to complications from her injuries, and Matthews called 999. \nWhen doctors examined Miss Bi's body they found evidence of nine previous rib fractures and a healing jaw fracture - all inflicted by Matthews. \nBruises from the fresh injuries covered a third of her body and were so extensive one paramedic thought she had been dead for some time, the court heard. \nMatthews, of Ely Road, Cardiff, who told police he was a black belt in karate but later admitted that was not true, pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denied murder. Jordan Matthews denied murdering his girlfriend and said he 'missed and loved her' (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nA jury rejected his claim he had not intended to hurt Miss Bi and found him guilty of murder. \nSentencing him at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said the assault was the \"tragic culmination\" of a course of physical and verbal abuse over a number of months. \nShe said of Miss Bi's inability to speak out about what was happening to her, even while in hospital with injuries inflicted by Matthews: \"Nothing better demonstrates the fear that you engendered in this educated and intelligent young woman than her inability to tell of your abusive conduct.\" A jury rejected his claim he had not intended to hurt Miss Bi and found him guilty of murder. (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nMrs Justice Davies said Miss Bi was \"no physical match\" for Matthews and added: \"You lied and lied again in order to attempt to exculpate yourself from the overwhelming evidence which was that during the early hours of August 19 2016 your relentlessly and remorselessly inflicted physical injury upon a defenceless young woman.\" \nMrs Justice Davies described how as the months went on, friends and Xixi's brother, Zexun, saw her become quieter, thinner and more withdrawn and how neighbours heard Matthews shouting at her. They told the court they heard him say things such as: \"I don't want to do this, I've got to punish you for what you have done,\" and: \"If you don't s*** my d*** I'm going to hit you.\" \nMr Bi said in a victim impact statement, read out in court, that his sister had been due to run their family's multimillion-pound company. Matthews will serve at least 18 years in prison for the savage murder (Photo: WALES NEWS SERVICE) \nHe said: \"She was intelligent and had the whole world in front of her. \"All this taken from her, due to Jordan Matthews and his selfish and violent attack on my sister... the heart has been ripped out of our family.\" \nMiss Bi was seen to have black eyes and was forced to resit a year of her course after missing deadlines. \nMrs Justice Davies outlined the abusive relationship between Matthews and Miss Bi, who was described as \"a generous and loving young woman\". \nMatthews and Miss Bi met in April 2015 \"When you met Xixi you were unemployed,\" she said. \"She was the daughter of wealthy parents living in China. \"Xixi provided you with a home, clothing, she bought a car for you. You took what she gave.\" Representing Matthews, Christopher Henley QC said Matthews was \"sincerely sorry\". \n\"He misses her, he loved her, but he accepts that the way he treated her was atrocious,\" he said. \nHe added that a statement from Matthews' mother said there had been \"serious domestic violence\" in his childhood. \nMatthews will serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars before being considered for parole.
