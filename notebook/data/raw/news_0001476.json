A crew cut the power at 6.50pm and worked to replace the pole by 10.30pm. \nHendrickson said the live wires highlighted a safety issue and urged the public to remember to never approach power lines. \nHe said fallen lines could be live and if people saw fallen lines they should \"steer clear, keep others away and report it immediately.\" \nNelson Marlborough Rescue Helicopter pilot Tim Douglas-Clifford said the chopper came across the incident as it was coming back from Upper Buller Gorge to another road accident just after 5pm. Ad Feedback \nHe said the driver was \"lucky\" to come away uninjured from the crash and there was no need to transport him to hospital. \nDouglas-Clifford said the helicopter was earlier called to a car crash between Inangahua Junction and Murchison, but was not needed. \nNo one was trapped or injured in the crash. Police said one person suffered shock as a result of the crash, and the two vehicles in the incident blocked both lanes of traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:11:07.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
