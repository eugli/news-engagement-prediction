These will include five wallabies, three caracals and three green peafowls among others.Sakkarbaug zoo will soon get seven animals including a pair of African cheetahs from London zoo in exchange of one pair of Asiatic lion. In 2009, the zoo got four African cheetahs from Sing apore zoo under animal exchange programme. However, three of them died due to various reasons and only one female survived. \"Asiatic lions are in great demand from zoos across the world. Of late, zoos are emphasising on pure breed species and Sakkarbaug zoo is one place where one can find pure breed of Asi atic lions.
