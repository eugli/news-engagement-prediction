Sleep research now shows he may be right. Teen biology creates a later sleep cycle for adolescents — they fall asleep later, which means they wake up later as well. Accordingly, a major education policy reform is staring education officials in the face, in the form of bleary-eyed students who would clearly benefit from different school hours. The formula is simple: A school bell that rings later could equal better academic performance. About 60 percent of high school students report extreme daytime sleepiness ; one study found that only 15 percent of adolescents get the recommended minimum of 8.5 hours of sleep on school nights. Extrapolate that to cover the roughly 300,000 high school students in the Commonwealth who start their school day at an average of 7:37 a.m., and it adds up to 255,000 sleep-deprived students. Advertisement That’s despite guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics that recommend starting both middle and high school no earlier than 8:30 a.m. In Boston, according to a Globe report, more than half of the nearly three dozen public high schools start an hour or more earlier than that. Out of 37 Boston public high schools, 15 begin before 7:10 a.m. For a teenager with a fast-developing brain, waking up that early is the equivalent of an adult getting up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. For some students, sleep deprivation leads to the kind of poor school functioning that can have a domino effect: tardiness, bad grades, depression, anxiety, increased risk of car accidents, vulnerability to substance abuse — and in some cases a lack of sleep gets misdiagnosed as ADHD.

When students from economically disadvantaged households arrive at school on time, they’re more likely to stay in class and graduate.
