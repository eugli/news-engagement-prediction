Where did this degenerate come from?”\nAnother added: “What a mad son of a bitch! There’s cameras and police everywhere in that area. He must have been mad or on drugs or both.”\nEarly last year a man - thought to be totally unconnected to the savage attack on the woman - was filmed running naked along Mar del Plata’s seafront.\nThe bizarre incident happened at dawn and the starkers jogger failed to stop despite locals filming him.\n Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On CCTV Hospitals CCTV footage Homelessness", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3501/4221396001_5320135887001_5320096113001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-12T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:48:33.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
