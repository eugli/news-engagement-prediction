Even Liam Gallagher was impressed, for the most part. \nTwitter exploded during and after the game, and one of Manchester City's biggest fans, Liam Gallagher, produced a typically nonchalant post on Twitter to describe the performance of referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz. \nManchester City were denied a penalty by Spanish referee Lahoz when striker Sergio Aguero appeared to be kicked by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic , wich left the majority of social media disgraced by the decision, including Gallagher. \nIf you had to show somebody a representation of what the Oasis singer is like on social media, then just send them this.No messing about: - Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) February 21, 2017 \nFortunately for Gallagher and co, the refereeing decision turned out to be irrelevant. Goals from Raheem Sterling, Sergio Aguero (2), John Stones and Leroy Sane sealed an important win for Pep Guardiola's side. \nBut former Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao stole the show with an incredible dink over the helpless head of Willy Caballero . \nHere's that goal one more time: :heart_eyes: Le bijou de @FALCAO sur la pelouse de l'Etihad Stadium !!! #CITYASM pic.twitter.com/tQUgdmVHYa - AS MONACO :flag_mc: (@AS_Monaco) February 22, 2017 What a game!
