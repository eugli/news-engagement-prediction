Look at his pants! What's going on, buddy? \nThe sweatpants in question are by ultra-hip Vetements, and they originally retailed for around $700, but you can buy them on sale for $483! \nImage: justoneeye.com \nIn paparazzi shots taken sometime around the video, he strolls around checking his phone and sipping on green juice seeming unfazed by the curiously positioned stain. \nThis is a good thing. As we spend our days clawing our way out from under each fresh catastrophe, there are more pressing things on the agenda than controlling our bladders or ever changing out of a pair of sweatpants that makes us feel safe and warm. \nSure, maybe he just spilled his drink, but Justin Bieber urine incidents are one thing we can rely on as surely as the sun sets each evening. Let's not forget the time Biebs peed in bucket at a nightclub exclaiming, \"Fuck Bill Clinton!\" \nWe hope Bieber's latest exploit brings you peace and purpose.
