Now they’ve gone to a flat, full ground contact outsole with a very thin web of rubber that gives you some stretch, but eliminates those pods. \nUp top, you still get the knit upper and a really firm plastic clip at the bottom of the heel. It really locks in your heel and doesn’t allow it to move. But it’s really small, so it doesn’t create a lot of weight. There’s also a really quick drying, ventilated collar lining, a thin tongue (just enough to keep the laces off the top of your foot), and a very ventilated knit upper. Skechers is keeping things light for this fast shoe. \nBy contrast, you get more midsole on the GOMeb Razor. The GOMeb Speed 4 has 4 millimeters of heel drop, while the GOMeb Razor has 8 millimeters, which is a more traditional offset. You also get thicker stacks in general, so there’s more material under the forefoot and more underneath the heel. \nYou still get the knit upper in the Razor, and there’s a lot of ventilation as well. It’s just a little more stout, really hoping to help you on those longer training runs. \nThe Skechers GOMeb Speed 4 retails for $130, and the Skechers GOMeb Razor retails for $110. We have both shoes on the feet of our wear testers now and we will have more detailed reviews soon on RunnersWorld.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:32:43.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
