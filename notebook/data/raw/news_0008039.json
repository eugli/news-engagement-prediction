You tend to pick a side and it becomes an emotional thing for you. \nSince crossing over from rugby league in 2000, Mundine has worn the black hat in boxing's theatre. \nHe virtually hand-picked Green as his chief rival, an opponent who appeals to mainstream Australia. \nEarlier this week, Mundine reiterated his intention to follow the lead of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and refuse to stand for the national anthem ahead of his bout with Green at Adelaide Oval on Friday night. \nMundine's actions have been labelled 'un-Australian' by some commentators. \nIn fact it is, very Australian. It is not obligatory to stand for the anthem, as is our democratic right. \nIt is anti-Australian at its core to encourage people to conform to what they believe is unjust. \nMundine's eloquence is sometimes lacking, but his conscience would not allow him to stand until the inequality he sees is remedied. \nEducation and income still differ along racial lines in this country. \nThe anomaly of the entire sideshow is that it is commonplace in boxing for the anthems to be sung before either fighter leaves the dressing room. \nMundine steps between the ropes a substantial underdog on Friday night. \nThe most salient question going in is whether Mundine can take Green's power? \nMundine does not take the best punch even against fighters his own size. \nHistorically, there are so few examples of larger power punches being upset by light punching smaller fighters. \nFor this reason, it is the kind of fight that can end at any moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:31:26.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
