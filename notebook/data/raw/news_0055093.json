Screw it up, and they could lose control of their company. Game over. Back to grad school. \nSo, in a stroke of desperate inspiration, Page and Brin found themselves turning to an unusual selection process, a brutal filtration system both strikingly similar to Navy SEAL Basic Underwater Demolition training (BUD/S ) and as wildly different as it could get. \nLike the SEALs' infamous Hell Week, a finalist for Google's CEO job would have to spend five nearly sleepless days and nights enduring oppressive sun, freezing cold, and a 24/7 barrage of VUCA conditions (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). Pushed to physical and psychological extremes, the prospective leader would have nowhere to hide. Would he retreat into himself? Or could he merge with the team? \nOf course, there were a few differences. Unlike the San Diego beach where BUD/S prospects prove themselves, the beach Page and Brin had in mind hadn't seen flowing water in nearly fifteen thousand years. It was now a bone-dry lake bed in the middle of Nevada's Black Rock Mountains. The site of Burning Man, one of the stranger rites of passage in modern times. \nAnd rite of passage is the right phrase. This teeming, temporary carnival of tens of thousands has its own quirky customs, exotic rituals, and a fiercely dedicated following. It's a modern-day Eleusis, a Bacchanalian blowout, the Party at the End of Time—take your pick. But there's no denying the truth: Something happens out there. The Google founders were regular and enthusiastic participants in Burning Man. JIM URQUHART / Reuters \nAnd Page and Brin were regular and enthusiastic attendees . The company that set the bar for catered perks ran free shuttle buses to the event. For many years, the two-story atrium of Building 43, Google's main headquarters, wasn't decorated with industry accolades or stock-ticker flat screens. Instead, it showcased pictures of loincloth-wearing, fire-spinning Googlers and their eclectic Burning Man art projects. \nIn fact, the very first Google Doodle , posted in the late summer of 1998, was a crude stick figure of the Burning Man himself. Made from two commas set back to back, centered over the second yellow o in Google, that cryptic icon signified to those in the know that Page and Brin were turning out the lights in Palo Alto and lighting out for the Nevada badlands. \nSo, when the founders heard that Eric Schmidt , the 46-year-old veteran of Sun Microsystems and a Berkeley Ph.D. computer scientist, was the sole CEO finalist who had already been to the event, they rejiggered their rankings and gave the guy a callback. \"Eric was . . . the only one who went to Burning Man,\" Brin told Doc Searls, then a Berkman Center fellow at Harvard. \"We thought [that] was an important criterion.\" \nStanford sociologist Fred Turner agrees, arguing that the festival's appeal to Silicon Valley is that it brings that hive mind experience to the masses. \"[It] transforms the work of engineering into . . . a kind of communal vocational ecstasy.\" One of Turner's research subjects, a Googler himself, explained his experience on a pyrotechnic team: \"[We were] very focused, very few words, open to anything . . . no egos. We worked very tightly. . . . I loved the 'feeling of flow' on the team—it was an extended, ecstatic feeling of interpersonal unity and timelessness we shared throughout.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:12:39.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
