Words written in permanent marker were discovered over the holiday weekend on stone at the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and the World War II Memorial. Pictures taken before the service began to carefully remove the vandalism on Tuesday morning show three brief tirades, hard to read and written in black ink. Hand writing experts have said they believe they were all written by the same person. Despite being rambling and incoherent, the most obvious message said, 'Jackie shot JFK'. Another of the messages referenced the 9/11 attacks and another mentioned HIV, leukemia and cancer and 'blood tests'. Shock: A news videographer works to tape the graffiti on the World War II Memorial on Tuesday Rambling: 'Jackie shot JFK,' read one of the lines of graffiti. '9/11 - Misty pilots flew planes into WTC,' read another line' A spokesperson for the US Park Police said that the same messages were written at all three monuments between 9pm and 11pm on Saturday. Initially, reports indicated that the graffiti covered a small space. It was described as not overtly political or hate-filled. Park service spokesman Mike Litterst says because of similarities in what's written and the handwriting, it's thought the graffiti was left by the same person. He says park service staffers are skilled in removing graffiti, but they have to be careful not to further damage the stone. US Park Police are investigating and reviewing surveillance footage from the monuments. Nonsensical: Initially, the graffiti was described as not overtly political or hate-filled. But a closer examination reveals that the graffiti contained conspiracy theories about the September 11 terrorist attacks and the assassination of President John F.
