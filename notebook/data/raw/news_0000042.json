(ABC News: Xavier La Canna) \nWeather forecasters are predicting a monsoon will bring heavy falls and winds to the Top End by the weekend. \nSenior forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), Graeme King, said there was an almost 100 per cent chance of rain on the weekend in Darwin. \n\"That monsoon trough, it is right on the north coast now,\" Mr King said. \n\"It strengthens up over the next day or so, so by the time we get into the weekend it is almost 100 per cent chance of rain and gusty squalls and all sorts of good monsoonal weather. \n\"It seriously looks like a good monsoon.\" \nMonsoons are associated with wetter weather, more cloud and cooler temperatures. \nMr King said it was difficult to know exactly where the monsoon would be focused. \n\"Once it starts focusing you do get some heavy falls, [but we] can't tell where that is going to happen yet,\" he said. \nThe wind is also likely to be strong. \n\"Once that westerly surge arrives some time later tomorrow or Saturday we will start to see those winds really ramp-up,\" Mr King said.
