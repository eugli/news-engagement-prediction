Succeeding the Galaxy Tab S2, the Tab S3 should be a thin, high-end tablet running Android 7 Nougat out of the box. Earlier this month, we saw what could be the rear of the Galaxy Tab S3 , and now we have an image showing its front. As you can see below, the Galaxy Tab S3 doesn't look too different from the Tab S2, though there is one notable novelty: the new tablet is accompanied by an S Pen stylus . However, it's said that the slate does not have a stylus cradle, which means the S Pen will be a separate accessory (likely offered at no extra cost). S Pen stylus aside, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 supposedly features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4 GB of RAM, up to 128 GB of storage space, and a 12 MP + 5 MP camera combo (rear and front).Contrary to previous rumors, WinFuture notes that the Galaxy Tab S3 won't come in multiple sizes. Thus, it's expected that only a version with a 9.7-inch, 1536 x 2048 pixels display will be released - in Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi + LTE flavors. Reportedly, US carriers are planning to sell the LTE model for about $500.The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 will be announced on February 26 . Do you think you'll want to pick one up once it hits shelves?
