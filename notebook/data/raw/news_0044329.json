Sometimes it feels so good to just let yourself be petty AF. Thatâs why this story is going viral: A guy graded his exâs apology letter , complete with red pen, grammar corrections,and a grade of âD-minusâ at the end. He posted the âgradedâ letter on Twitters, and readers have liked it more than 314,000 times. This guyâs savage critique of his exâs apology might not be nice , necessarily, but it sure is satisfying . \nNick Lutz, a student at the University of Central Florida, told BBC Newsbeat that he received a lengthy apology letter from his ex-girlfriend, shortly after they broke up following 8 months of dating. He then (figuratively) shredded the four-page letter with red pen, pointing out grammatical mistakes, highlighting bad handwriting, and making comments like, âToo long of an introduction, lots of repetitionâ and âNo supporting details to support your hypothesis.â \nUltimately, Lutz gave the letter a D-minus, with the comment , Long intro, short conclusion, short hypothesis but nothing to back it up. Details are important. If you want to be believed, back it up with proof. You claim that cheating never occurred but place blame on yourselfâ then what for? Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side. While this gesture is appreciated I would prefer details over statements. Revision for half credit will be accepted. When your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back pic.twitter.com/MczdjcCiil Source: Nick Lutz on Twitter \nLutz told BBC Newsbeat that he didnât expect the letter to viral when he tweeted it and that his ex is ânot the happiestâ about it. âI feel a little [bit] guilty but at the same time, I don't believe the letter at all,â he said . âI've been lied to before by her.â \nTwitter users are having a field day with the letter, often pointing out additional grammatical issues. @NickLutz12 there were quite a few missing apostrophes in contractions, if you wanna count off points for that too :( đ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:14:41.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
