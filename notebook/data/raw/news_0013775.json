By: FE Online | Updated: February 5, 2017 10:17 AM The newly appointed LG Anil Baijal will be taking this up after Najeeb Jung has left his seat. (IE) \nDelhi government will still stand with the proposal of having their own lawyers in the Supreme Court, said sources. Recently resigned, lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung had canceled the appointments of the 15 lawyers including three advocates on record and 12 arguing counsels. The newly appointed LG Anil Baijal will be taking this up after Jung has left his seat. Jung had called a cabinet meeting which was in favor of AAP’s proposal, where he argued that the decision to retain 15 counsels picked by Delhi government to fight its cases is unacceptable and “in total disregard of the President of India”. \nThis flagged issue will now have to be dealt by Baijal. Jung’s order had stated: “It seems the proposal before the Cabinet was not initiated or processed through the law department. The same is also substantiated by a note placed by Deputy CM before the council of ministers for circulation to all departments, as it does not bear any signature or authentication by secretary law and justice.” \nJung stated that the cabinet decision in illegal because the provisions of the transaction of business rules (TBR) were not followed in processing the cabinet decision. “The ministers violated the provisions of Section 49 of GNCTD Act, 1991, which makes it obligatory for the Delhi government to comply with directions given by the President from time to time. The decision is in disregard to the President of India,” stated the order issued by Jung on December 20, 2016. \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \nBut a cabinet had rejected his decision and favored retaining the counsels.
