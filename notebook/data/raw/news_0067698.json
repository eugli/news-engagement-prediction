Well done. \nFor some reason, in this day and age, some guys still go out of their way to catcall , even though ten times out of ten it leads nowhere. Well, in this situation it led to a hilarious conclusion. \nWe love seeing people get what is coming to them, just like this biker who got revenge on a dude who flipped him off on the road. But the video below is perhaps an even better example of sweet revenge. The video kicks off with a woman on a bike on the streets of London being catcalled and harassed by some idiots in a van. The woman hears everything from “You on your period?” to “Give me your number.” One of the men even tries to touch her, before driving off. \nWell, this woman wasn’t going to put up with this nonsense. Look what she does next. Woman Gets Awesome Revenge On Catcallers Who Were Harassing Her \nShoutout to this woman for having the strength to rip that mirror off, and then peddling away like the ultimate badass. Now those idiots have to pay for a mirror simply because they decided to act like total tools. \nSo the lesson here is to not harass women. I feel like that should go without saying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:57:14.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
