The school later confirmed that Washington was part of the football program when the incident occurred, but was immediately terminated when the school learned of the arrest. \nWashington came to Baylor shortly after new head coach Matt Rhule was hired. In 2016, Washington worked on the strength training staff at Temple University, where Rhule was head coach until he was hired away by Baylor in December. \n“When we arrived at Baylor we made a commitment to character and integrity in our program,” Rhule said in a statement. “Brandon’s actions are completely unacceptable. We will not tolerate conduct that is contradictory to these values.” \nThe news is the latest stain on a Baylor program that has been trying to restore its image since the revelations of multiple sexual assault allegations during former head coach Art Briles’ tenure. Just three days ago, documents were released showing text messages purportedly sent by Briles that seemed to encourage assistants to keep some of those matters quiet.
