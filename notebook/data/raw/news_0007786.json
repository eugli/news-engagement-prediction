Ad Feedback \nIt was a test message, generated by a training group, she said. \nCivil Defence recently came under fire after \"unacceptable\" confusion with its tsunami warnings in the wake of November's Kaikoura 7.8-magnitude earthquake. \nAt the time residents in Napier , Wellington , Christchurch and Southland complained about mixed messages regarding the tsunami risk, with a lack of clarity around which areas needed to evacuate and why sirens were not sounded. \nActing Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee signalled emergency management systems could be overhauled to ensure there was no repeat of the chaos which came after the quake struck. \nFollowing the M7.8 quake the Civil Defence director said there was also information \"that was not factually correct\" in a press release which warned of a large aftershock. \n\"The Ministry of Civil Defence is issuing an advisory regarding the possibility of large aftershock,\" the press release, issued by West Coast Civil Defence on November 24, said. \nAftershock activity in the area had been \"suspiciously quiet\", it said, saying \"there is a possibility of large aftershocks in the area designated by Geonet on their probability map\". \nThe statement was retracted and an apology was issued. Civil Defence said New Zealanders should listen to GeoNet scientists when it came to aftershock probabilities. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:42:19.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
