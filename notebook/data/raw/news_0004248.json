The petition’s argument is that an environment where families and children come for a fun time may not be the right one for Trump’s “hateful speech, misogyny, racism and xenophobia.” \n“He has tainted the legacy of the American Presidency forever,” the petition reads. “The Magic Kingdom at Disney World is a place specifically designed for the enjoyment of children and families. Therefore, it is not an appropriate place for a Donald Trump speech. We ask that Walt Disney World take a stand against divisive and hurtful rhetoric and have the backs of millions of Americans and people worldwide whose day would be ruined by the depiction of a speech by Donald Trump.” \nThe petition has a preliminary target of 15,000 signatures, at which point it says it will be delivered to The Walt Disney Company. The attraction itself is currently closed so that the new animatronic figure can be installed, and it is scheduled to reopen in June. As part of the attraction, the sitting president typically gives a speech. “We will no longer be annual pass holders and very saddened if Disney adds the Trump speech,” read one comment on the petition. \nEarlier today, Variety reported that Disney CEO Bob Iger won’t attend a planned meeting on Friday of President Donald Trump’s strategic and policy forum due to a previously scheduled meeting. Iger’s planned participation on the panel had already caused controversy, as on Tuesday, the corporate watchdog group SumOfUs called for Iger to step down from the panel.
