Gucci Mane will also play both weekends of Coachella , while the trek wraps with back-to-back appearances at the JMBLYA festival in Dallas and Austin, May 5th and 6th, respectively. Tickets for most shows go on sale February 24th. \nGucci Mane has performed scattered concerts throughout his career, though never embarked on a full tour. Last year, after finishing a two-year prison sentence, he played a July homecoming concert at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, followed by one-offs throughout the fall and winter. \nIn an interview with Marilyn Manson for CR Men's Book , Gucci Mane spoke about his first tour saying, \"I'm a hell of a recording artist, but I want to be a better live performer.\" He cited the Flaming Lips as an inspiration for his live set, adding, \"I'm not saying I want to do it just like they did it, but I want people to feel like that when they come to my show. I just want it to be like a big party. I want people to sweat. I don't want people to come trying to look all pretty. No, I want you to leave the concert wet as hell, like you've been working out for damn near an hour and a half.\" \nGucci Mane's Trap God Tour follows the rapper's remarkable 2016 tear during which he released three solo projects – Everybody Looking , Woptober and The Return of East Atlanta Santa – and several collaborative mixtapes and EPs. In January, the rapper revealed the title of his next album, Drop Top Wop , though a release date has yet to be announced. \nGucci Mane Trap God Tour Dates \nApril 5 – Boston, MA @ House of BluesApril 6 – Wallingford, CT @ Oakdale TheatreApril 9 – New York, NY @ Terminal 5April 12 – Chicago, IL @ Chicago TheatreApril 13 – Milwaukee, WI @ Eagles BallroomApril 14 – Detroit, MI @ The Fox TheatreApril 15 – Indio, CA @ CoachellaApril 16 – Santa Ana, CA @ The ObservatoryApril 17 – San Francisco, CA @ The WarfieldApril 18 – Portland, OR @ Theatre of the CloudsApril 20 – Denver, CO @ Ogden TheatreApril 22 – Indio, CA @ CoachellaApril 24 – Columbus, OH @ Express Live!April 25 – Philadelphia, PA @ The Liacouras CenterApril 26 – Pittsburgh, PS @ Stage AEApril 27 – Washington, D.C. @ EchostageMay 2 – Miami, FL @ Fillmore Miami BeachMay 5 – Dallas, TX @ JMBLYAMay 6 – Austin, TX @ JMBLYA More News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:23:59.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
