It is a similar story with detergent wipes, with Croydon Health Services NHS Trust paying £2.60 a pack, while the Plymouth Hospitals trust pays just £1.38. Procurement is not the only problem. Using Freedom of Information requests, we have also found how NHS trusts have written off millions of pounds due to drugs waste and salary overpayments. East Kent Hospitals wrote off £1.5 million because of a problem with a ‘cleanroom’ in 2014-15, and another £437,515 in 2015-16. When a fridge used to store medicines at University Hospitals Birmingham malfunctioned, drugs worth £239,697 had to be thrown out. NHS trusts have written off millions of pounds due to drugs waste and salary overpayments (file photo) A similar problem, with a faulty fridge thermostat at United Lincolnshire Hospitals, led to drugs losses of £77,000. Rather than continuing to chase an employee paid £51,060 too much, Frimley Health Foundation Trust in Surrey wrote it off, as did Lancashire Teaching Hospitals Trust in a similar instance, costing £6,130. Last night NHS Improvement, the quango responsible for financial matters, claimed major steps were being taken to cut waste, after a damning report by Labour peer Lord Carter was published a year ago. A spokesman said: ‘Lord Carter’s report showed that £5 billion of efficiencies can be made if each hospital operated as efficiently as good performers. Since the report, NHS Improvement has been helping hospitals to implement the recommendations by supporting them to understand where they need to improve. ‘This programme is progressing at pace across every area of the hospital, and we’re pleased with the demonstrable enthusiasm being shown by NHS clinical leaders. Initiatives such as Getting It Right First Time have provided better outcomes for trauma and orthopaedics patients while also generating almost £50 million in efficiencies.’ He said a new ‘benchmarking tool’ being developed showed that up to £270 million could be saved per year if NHS trusts secured the best prices for most products. He added: ‘It will provide full transparency and the ability for NHS Improvement to see what prices trusts are paying suppliers.’ Trust sent its internal post on 90-mile round trip Former chief executive Jean O'Callaghan warned her 5,200 staff not to sent important internal mail with the Royal Mail, costing the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust BY JONATHAN BUCKS FOR THE MAIL ON SUNDAY Like many large organisations, the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust has a ‘pigeon post’ internal mailing system. It is supposed to provide a speedy and cost-effective way of getting documents between departments. But for reasons not entirely clear, some staff used Royal Mail instead. It meant mail was sent on a 90-mile round trip from the hospital in Reading to a sorting office in Swindon and back again. The extraordinary waste of public cash was revealed in a blog written last year by then-chief executive Jean O’Callaghan, who urged her 5,200 staff not to be so careless. In a post entitled ‘Shooting ourselves in the foot’, she wrote: ‘Did you know that some staff send internal letters by first or second-class post? These letters are sent out and delivered back again – costing us money which we cannot afford to waste. ‘If you have letters for colleagues that need to go through the internal mail, especially to other sites, and it is urgent, you could either scan and email it, or mark it urgent and take it to the post room. ‘We need to take more care of unnecessary waste like this.’ Last night a hospital spokesman said: ‘While this is no longer a concern as most staff communicate via secure email, as with every organisation running a multi-site operation, staff are periodically reminded that internal mail to colleagues on other sites should go through the internal mail network.’ This cosy cartel of NHS suppliers is ripping us all off, says former health minister DR DAN POULTER Dr Dan Poulter says: 'Our hospitals are getting ripped off left, right and centre' The NHS has enormous purchasing power. Its hundreds of hospitals across England buy equipment – from loo paper to CT scanners – worth at least £22 billion every year. But many people would be surprised if they knew just how poorly the NHS uses its financial muscle to strike a good deal from its suppliers. In short, our hospitals are getting ripped off left, right and centre. And with £18 in every £100 you pay in tax being spent on the NHS, that means you’re getting ripped off. As a Health Minister in the Coalition Government, I had a team look into how much hospitals could save by ‘buying better’ from their suppliers. The staggering answer? At least £2 billion a year. That sort of money would pay for a lot more doctors and nurses. We made some headway by getting local groups of hospitals to work together so they could drive better deals with suppliers. But we never achieved the big prize – of forcing suppliers to state publicly a unit price for everything they sold to the NHS. If managers in one hospital could see how much less their counterparts in the next town were paying for surgical gloves, disinfectant wipes or intravenous cannulas, they could get better deals. Transparent pricing would drive prices down across the board – saving the NHS colossal sums of money, to be reinvested into frontline patient care. We knew we were on to something when the big medical product companies made it clear they would fight us tooth and nail. These firms operate by giving NHS buyers the impression they are getting a good deal. But that can often be smoke and mirrors. For instance, a supplier will give a hospital trust what looks like a great price on a big-ticket item as a sweetener. But the firm will insist the hospital keeps the price secret and will also insist it has to buy a whole suite of other products. So while NHS managers think they are getting a good deal, in reality they don’t really know. The big medical suppliers are using this price secrecy to divide and rule individual trusts. That is why they started lobbying the Government at the highest level when I put forward the plan to have a price-transparency clause inserted in all NHS supplier contracts. In quiet conversations, they implicitly threatened to cut investment in Britain’s life sciences industry if we forced them to come clean on prices. I believed this was a largely empty threat, but to my intense frustration we failed to make progress in delivering the price transparency that could save the NHS so much money. It’s a great shame. Because as the NHS struggles to meet the demands of our growing and ageing population, it can ill afford to swell the coffers of a cosy cartel of companies.
