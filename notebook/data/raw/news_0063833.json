They keep their head high with charm and grace. Recently, actress Disha Patani did something similar when she was being slammed on Instagram. \nThe 24-year-old actress on Tuesday posted a heartfelt message on her social media page in the form on an image. \"Really felt a need to share this! thanks to my fan clubs friends and family for always giving me the strength i hope we all can find this strength from within each other and stop suffering #spreadlove,\" she captioned the note.

Strangely, she is not the only celeb who has been targeted on the internet. A number of celebrities have been trolled in the past too. \nOn the professional front, she is enjoying the Box Office success of her latest release Jackie Chan starrer 'Kung Fu Yoga'.
