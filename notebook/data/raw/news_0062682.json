By Tweet \nThe reserve goalkeeper received a range of online tributes after his pie-eating performance, despite not even playing a single minute on the field, with the 46-year-old being labelled a 'legend' and a 'hero'. More from the 'Wayne Shaw Is A Legend' files. Here he is eating a pie. During the game. pic.twitter.com/N4iAHQOJxg \nIt capped off quite a chaotic night for Shaw, who was spotting vacuuming the dugout prior to kick-off and in the bar at half-time, being digging it to his pie. All in a night's work! Wayne Shaw v Arsenal: \n‚úÖ Hoovered the dugout before kick-off‚úÖ Went the bar at half-time‚úÖ Ate a pie during the match \nHero of the FA Cup üòÇüëè pic.twitter.com/wrqaZ9y1k8 \n‚Äî Craig Norenbergs (@CraigNorenbergs) February 20, 2017 \nBut while the 45-year-old, who also works as part of Sutton's coaching staff, has seemingly etched his name into FA Cup history with his 'heroics', it has been revealed that there was in fact a betting market on him eating during the match. \nThe 'roly-poly' goalkeeper was rated at odds of 8/1 with Sun Bets to be seen eating a pie on television and the 45-year-old made it happen in a 'stunt'. Before you start sharing the HILARIOUS images of the fat keeper eating a pie, just remember it's all a stunt for The Sun. pic.twitter.com/OL9Lp8QMZu \n‚Äî Elliot Hackney (@ElliotHackney) February 20, 2017 \nShaw could now be in strife with the FA after possibly breaking the governing body's rules on gambling. \nFA regulations state that a player should not ‚Äúinstruct, permit, cause or enable‚Äù any person to bet the ‚Äúresult, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.‚Äù \nSpeaking after the game, Shaw admitted he knew about the Sun Bets offer, although he denied that he or any other Sutton player had placed a bet. \n‚ÄúA few of the lads said to me earlier on 'What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie? I said: 'I don't know, I've eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on,'‚Äù he said. \n‚ÄúI thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down.‚Äù \nWhen asked whether he knew of anyone who had placed a bet on him eating it, Shaw said: ‚ÄúI think there were a few people. Obviously we [Sutton's players] are not allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans.\" Sutton show fight, but Arsenal too strong in magical Cup night Arsenal ended Sutton United's remarkable FA Cup run to book a place in the last eight, but the 2-0 scoreline will have done little to protect under-fire manager Arsene Wenger from further criticism.
