The result: he couldn't perform.\nSpeaking to Bangalore Times , a visibly hurt Shubhendra said, 'The airline surgically opened my instrument and broke it. I was travelling from Vienna to Nice. Two hours before my performance in Nice, I opened my instrument box to found that they had surgically prised it open. Of course, I couldn't do the concert. I can't even begin to explain the mental agony that I went through. The sitar is like a part of my body; I don't have two hands, I have three, because as a musician, you become very emotionally attached to your instrument. It's like watching your child being slaughtered. A single individual cannot take on a corporate, which is why I have created a lot of pressure on social media. There have been many responses, since I am not the first, nor am I going to be the last person (to who this has happened). The airline responded because of the online pressure, but they have not given any explanation ' they just said that they regret the inconvenience caused and that there will be an investigation.'\nThe musician says that this was more than just mishandling, and adds that there are other angles. 'One is that someone was searching for drugs inside the sitar. But it could also be a hate crime, because people are paranoid of anything different these days,' says Shubhendra.", "external_links": ["http://www.happytrips.com/topic/nice"], "published": "2017-02-26T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:47:22.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
