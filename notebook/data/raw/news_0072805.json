But data on voter turnout suggests that Mumbai houses a big chunk of sleeping, dormant, apathetic populace that forgets to fulfil the most basic obligation of casting their vote. \nFinal voting turnout across 10 civic body elections (all figures in percentage) \nBMC: 55 21:17 (IST) \n14 NCs registered in BMC Election 2017 \nApart from the 12 lakh voters' names that went missing and a few minor skirmishes, the BMC election 2017 went smoothly on Tuesday. The police registered 14 NC complaints across polling booths on Tuesday for minor reasons. One cognisable offence was also registered at the Antop Hill police station for causing obstruction to government officer while discharging his duty. There were no other serious untoward incidents reported at polling stations in Mumbai. 19:51 (IST) \nVoter turnout in municipal elections across Maharashtra (all figures in percentage) 18:30 (IST) \nFadnavis lauds Mumbai for \"record turnout\" Thank you #Mumbai for the record voting percentage & people from all Municipal Corporations & ZP for participating in festival of democracy! 18:18 (IST) \nSEC says they used same voter lists as provided by Election Commission of India \nRegarding the issue of a large number of voters not finding their names in the voter lists, State Election Commissioner JS Saharia has said they were referring to lists provided to them by the Election Commission of India. The list, which was sent on 5 January, 2017, was forwarded to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as well, he said. Voters part of this list are the same across Parliament, Assembly and municipal elections. \nWhen asked whose fault could it be that lakhs of voters across Mumbai find their names missing from voter lists, he replied saying SEC cannot be held responsible. The list was released on 5 January, and voters had the right to check if his/her name is present, he said. 17:59 (IST) \nShiv Sena demands probe into missing voters \nShiv Sena leader and MLC Anil Parab has alleged that names of lakhs of voters in Mumbai have gone missing form voters' list. Even those who had cast their votes in the previous civic elections held in 2012 have had to return empty handed from the polling stations. \"We have demanded a probe into why the voters' names have gone missing, and we'll file a written complaint in this regard with the state election commission as well,\" said Parab. 17:46 (IST) \nBJP candidate helping voters find their booth \nA BMC polling official at Ghatkopar's Gurukul School had an interesting story to narrate. In the morning, a BJP candidate from this constituency was sitting with the BMC volunteers and officials outside the polling booth to help voters find their booth and serial numbers. After a while, when it was noticed that the lists they were referring to had the lotus symbol on them, and thereby a violation of the code of conduct, a quarrel ensued outside the polling booth. 17:35 (IST) \nPolling centres begin shutting their gates \nPolling ends at 5.30 pm, and gates across the city have begun shutting down for the day. 17:22 (IST) \nTurnout figures by 3 pm (all figures in percentages) \nMumbai: 41.32 17:14 (IST) \nPoll officials made to sit since 8 am without food, water \nA brief chat with BMC polling officials at Ghatkopar's Gurukul School throws light on the sorry condition in which poll officials are treated in the country. Officials here say they have been sititng since 8 am, and haven't been provided with either lunch or snacks. Let alone food, they haven't even received any drinking water. Nobody has yet come in to relieve them of our duties. One just wonders how far is a public servant expected to go, just to let an indifferent city exercise its right to vote. 16:58 (IST) \nTurnouts to pick up as polling enters last hour \nAs polling enters the last one hour, voter turnouts are expected to pick up. At polling booths across the city, people have been arriving and queues are increasing in length once again. 16:15 (IST) 16:06 (IST) \n12 lakh voters disappear from voter lists across Mumbai \nA total of 12,00,000 voters who had voted in the previous 2012 BMC election were not allowed to exercise their franchise this time, as their names had disappeared from official voter lists. Among the chief reasons for this includes demarcation of wards. There are a total of 91.80 lakh voters in BMC. Mihir Ved, Roving Reporter 16:01 (IST) \nVishnu Chogle is a 68-year-old man who is unable to either walk or speak. There was also nobody in his family who could have brought him to the polling booth. But such was his desperation to cast his vote that he asked a neighbour to take him along. The neighbour Rajeshkumar Mishra said, \"Voting is our right and whether or not one'e vote brings about a significant change, we should all vote. It's this belief that he gets his strength from.\" 15:40 (IST) \nHawkers told to keep shutters down \nHawkers in Andheri have been asked to keep their shops shut till 5.30 pm, which is when polling for the day will end. People are standing around, watching the crowds vote. But nobody seems to be complaining of inconvenience. \"It's our duty to vote,\" said a hawker waiting for the clock to strike 5.30. \nAll sorts of promises set to go unfulfilled again \nSantacruz (East) resident Paramhans Chaubey cast his own vote early in the morning so that he could drive his taxi through the day and ferry voters to their voting stations. He seemed upset about the work done by the candidate in his area. \n\"They talk a good game and make big promises, but we don't know what they'll do after they get elected,\" he said. \nCould this be the most efficient voting station in Greater Mumbai? \nI spoke to nearly 20 voters who had come to vote at Ward 132's Municipal School on Tilak Road in Ghatkopar. There seems to be a unanimous opinion that the voting arrangements at this centre are spot-on. No long queues, no rude officials. Everything is moving along smoothly. \nPat yourselves on the back, Mumbai! At least you can say you're better than Pune... so far. Voting percentage till 1.30pm for #PCMC is 30.86 per cent while that for #Pune is 30.35 per cent 15:02 (IST) \nIf at first, you don't succeed... \nBhalchandra Kamble, a registered voter in Ward 27 of Kandivali (East) couldn't find his name on the voter list, but he didn't lose hope. He visited the three polling booths in the vicinity to find his name and was finally able to cast his vote after searching for his name for nearly two hours. \n\"Voting is my right; we all should be responsible and vote for candidates who work for the welfare of the society,\" he said. 14:58 (IST) 14:47 (IST) \nWhat the city really needs \"There is a need to install Corruption Perception Index, Cleanliness Perception Index, to sustain goodness in governance of Mumbai,\" says Shailesh Gandhi, RTI activist 14:46 (IST) \nIt’s time issue of public health becomes part of the public policy discourse \nIndia’s richest city is battling major challenges in public health. It faces issues such as sanitation, shortage of health personnel, uneven distribution of public health facilities and overall lags in the public healthcare delivery. \nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set aside Rs 3,693 crore to improve healthcare services out of a total budget for Rs 37,052 crore for the year 2016-17, which accounts for 9.96 percent of the total budget outlay of the corporation. Yet, there are too many health issues in Mumbai and the provisions to address those are far from enough. 14:39 (IST) \nBut he did violate the code of conduct \nOn Monday evening, Chheda tweeted his own posters, thereby violating the code of conduct. It's yet unknown what action will be taken against him. 14:36 (IST) \nPravin Chheda the only candidate with a criminal record in Ward No 132 \nPravin Chheda is the only candidate in Ghatkopar's Ward No 132 to have a criminal record, but that hasn't deterred voters. The buzz about polling booths here was that Chheda stands a good chance of victory. 14:31 (IST) \nCondition of BMC schools under the scanner \nOne positive aspect of the voting stations — a number of which are in BMC schools — is that citizens are actually exposed to the state of those schools. A woman was overheard complaining about the condition of one such school. \nPerhaps in the future, these very citizens will take the condition of BMC schools more seriously. 14:29 (IST) \nPositive noises coming from Ward 116 \nThe voter turnout in this ward has greatly improved on the previous election. And the key difference is that first-time voters are showing great enthusiasm. In fact, on a day when many people are grumbling about their names not appearing on electoral lists, one voter found his name on three lists and was infuriated about exactly where he was supposed to go. 14:24 (IST) \nPawar casts his vote from constituency without NCP candidates \nNCP chief Sharad Pawar exercised his franchise in a municipal ward in Mumbai, where nine candidates are contesting, but interestingly, none of them belongs to NCP. Pawar, along with son-in-law Sadanand Sule and grand-daughter Revati, voted at a polling booth in Ward No 214. There are nine candidates contesting from this ward, including those from Congress, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Shiv Sena. But since the Congress and NCP have a seat-sharing partnership in place, Pawar's party didn't put up a candidate from this seat. The candidates in the fray include Arvind Bane of Shiv Sena, Dhanraj Sahadev Naik of MNS, Kaushik Jasubhai Shah of Congress and Sarita Ajay Patil of BJP. \n- PTI 14:16 (IST) \nJust how much have parties spent on hoardings for this election? \nAccording to the data available with the BMC, the MMRDA, the MSRDC and the PWD Department, there are 3,600 hoardings in the BMC area, 50 percent of which are reserved for companies, corporate clients and for social awareness messages from the government. The remaining space is owned by Bright Outdoor Media, Global Advertisers and three other companies in Mumbai. \nA highly placed source from advertising told Firstpost that there are three hoardings of the BJP and two of the Shiv Sena. The BJP have put up more than 200 hoardings in Mumbai, Shiv Sena have over 100 hoardings. The hoardings of the Congress, and the NCP count up to 15, whereas MNS has about 10 hoarding sites, he added. \nThe charge for a 10 by 40 feet hoarding site is around Rs 2 lakh, the rate comes down if the client wants to keep it for two weeks. 14:14 (IST) \nFadnavis confident of good show by BJP \nMaharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has exuded confidence that people of Mumbai will support the party on basis of the work it has done in the state. \nFadnavis, who is facing a battle of prestige in election to 10 municipal corporations across Maharashtra, including the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, told reporters, \"I have full faith that on the basis of work we (BJP) have done, people will back us.\" \nFadnavis said voting is the responsibility of citizens and they should participate in the democratic process. \n-PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:40:38.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
