But to hear Justin Bieber tell it, the touchdown celebration dance has a long and storied history. Bieber stars in T-Mobile’s Super Bowl ad, themed around “Unlimited Moves” and T-Mobile’s unlimited data package. \nAs a self-professed “Celebration Expert,” Bieber walks viewers through the history of over-the-top antics. He watches the invention of the high-five and touchdown football spike in the stone age, with one caveman played by New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. From there, we see the shimmy and the shake, before former NFL player Terrell Owens shows off some of his trademark celebration moves. By the end, even Bieber’s dancing. \nThe ad comes with its own mini-contest. Fans can upload their own videos of their favorite celebration moves with the tag #UnlimitedMoves, and Bieber himself will choose and retweet his favorites on Monday, Feb. 6. \nWatch the commercial above.
