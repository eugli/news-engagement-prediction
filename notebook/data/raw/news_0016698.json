Toyota recently launched the C-HR in Japan and is already on sale in the UK. The all-new Toyota C-HR (Coupe High-Rider) represents a leap forward in design, manufacturing, and engineering for Toyota. Last year at the Los Angeles Auto Show, Scion debuted its stunning C-HR Concept. The new C-HR is based on Toyota's New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform, which is also seen in the Innova Crysta and the new Fortuner. Toyota C-HR \nALSO READ: 2017 Toyota Corolla Altis India launch slated for March? \nDesign: \nAt the C-HR's nose, two slim projector-beam halogen headlights with LED daytime running lights wrap deep into its toned shoulders - nearly all the way into the front quarter panels. Because of this, the vehicle looks wider than it is, and possesses an assertive fascia that's uncommon in the segment. Deep, curvy character lines emerge from a prominent Toyota badge that's flanked by the headlamps, and lead into the narrower core body. They run below the slender windows, and continue above the rear wheel where they marry to a high beltline and distinctive C-Pillar with integrated door handle. Toyota C-HR \nThe rear is a cohesive melding of its elaborate lines and 3D shapes. The tail lamps protrude outward, and the hatchback - outfitted with a lip spoiler and functional top wing - tapers neatly inboard, adding to the C-HR's futuristic look, and, once more, surprising girth. \nALSO READ: Toyota Fortuner races to 10,000 bookings since launch \nEngine: \nThe C-HR's engine, a punchy 2.0-litre, four-cylinder producing 144HP and 189NM of torque, sends all power to the front wheels via continuously variable transmission (CVT), mated to a seven-speed Sequential Shiftmatic gearbox. Toyota C-HR \nFeatures: \nThe slightly angled dashboard and amenity controls allows for the driver to have a clear view of the road ahead and intuitive access to instrumentation - a nod to the C-HR's sports car influence. The 7-inch audio display is positioned centrally atop the dash, an informative twin-ring gauge cluster resides behind the leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel. The wheel, with its slender profile, small diameter, and compact centre pad, is reminiscent of a sports car's easy-to-grip helm. A bright 4.2-inch color Multi-Information Display sits between the twin-ring cluster.
