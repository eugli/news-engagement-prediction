Are you traveling alone?’ ” says Sadri, whose bicoastal practice that has been visited by actor Aaron Paul, and athletes Jose Canseco and Gabby Douglas. \n“He didn’t speak a word of English and no one was with him,” Sadri said. “Out of nowhere, he runs down the aisle and starts screaming!” \nSadri says that’s when a flight attendant came over to see what was happening, and he joked: “Maybe Trump is trying to deport him.” \nAccording to Sadri, whose family moved to the U.S. when he was 3, the flight attendant snapped, “Don’t say that.” \nSadri says he figured that the “joke” might defuse the situation, but it did the opposite. \n“Fine, you must be a Trump supporter,” he said he told the flight attendant. “And she said, ‘What if I am?’ So I said ‘If you are, you are, but you’re also incompetent and need to do your job. Why am I dealing with this kid?’” \nAccording to Sadri, two other flight attendants came to their colleague’s aid and a three-on-one argument ensued. \n“I wasn’t yelling, I wasn’t swearing, it was 6 a.m., I hadn’t been drinking,” he said. “I’m a New Yorker — I’m not going to back down — and I was born a Muslim in Iran. I do think all those things played into it.” \nSadri says that security was “nice” as they booted him off of American Airlines Flight 292 and put him on the next American Airlines jet to New York, roughly an hour later. \nAn American Airlines rep confirms in an email, “A passenger was removed from our 6 a.m. flight to JFK yesterday for not following crew members’ instructions.” Neither the airline nor Sadri could tell us what those \"instructions\" were.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:20:13.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
