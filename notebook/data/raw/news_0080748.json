The president accused Obama of inciting the raucous town halls and leaks stemming from several federal agencies in an interview with Fox News’ \"Fox & Friends.\"\nFox News host Brian Kilmeade initially targeted Obama in his interview with the current president, telling Trump, \"it turns out [Obama’s] organization seems to be doing a lot of the organizing for some of the protests that a lot of these Republicans are seeing around the country, and against you.\"\nTrump supported the claim, taking it a step further: \"Right… No, I think he is behind it. I also think it’s politics. That’s the way it is. And look, I have a very thick skin.\"\n\nThe president went on to discuss the alleged secret operations Obama is overseeing in the wake of his presidency, suggesting his top aides have had a hand in recent leaks from the White House, as well as the national intelligence community’s federal departments like the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.\n\"You never know what’s exactly happening behind the scenes,\" Trump said. \"No, I think that President Obama is behind it, because his people are certainly behind it, and some of the leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad.\"\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest Obama participated in organizing demonstrations during several recent Republican town halls as of Tuesday. Instead, a group called \" Indivisible \" has been organizing thousands of protestors across the country to show their support for the former president’s health care initiatives and immigration reforms.\nObama hasn’t engaged in direct confrontation with the sitting president since Trump secured the presidency during his shocking electoral upset, but issued a single statement against his executive orders restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, as protests enveloped airports and highways across the country following the policy rollout in January.\n\n\"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\" Obama’s press office said in a statement Jan. 30. \"Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:22:21.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
