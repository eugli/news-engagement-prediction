Here’s what to do if you see a homeless person sleeping rough in the cold \nThey were then seen splitting up to beg for money in different parts of the city centre. \nLocals are so fed up with them that some have questioned whether one of the group who walks with a crutch is actually disabled. \nAccording to a witness they left their SatNav on its cradle and they paid for parking from 9am until 6pm – the maximum time allowed. One of the group used a child’s crutch (Picture: Andy Kelvin) One of the alleged ‘fake’ beggars (Picture: KNS News) They were pictured getting out of a car (Picture: Andy Kelvin) They arrived in Cambridge in a car registered in Romania (Picture: KNS News) \nWhen one of them was approached he said he was Italian and he said ‘I do not speak English’, according to MailOnline . \nLisa Jay from the British Red Cross said: ‘I have seen the man with the stick try his luck with myself and others as they walk into the bank. I have previously told him as I walked into the supermarket “I have no change”. Apps that tell you to walk 10,000 steps a day could be doing more harm than good \n‘After I left with my shopping, he was confrontational and spoke in English. \n‘They look to target the students who have some spare change and don’t want the hassle of turning them down. They bark at the kids – it’s easy prey to them.’ \nAsma Begum, 34, said: ‘I saw the group getting out of their car earlier this week, most days in fact. (Picture: Andly Kelvin) (Picture: KNS NEWS) beggars arrive in Cambridge by car, before putting money in a parking meter and heading into the city to beg. (www.knsnews.co.uk) \n‘When I have seen them, it appeared odd that the man with the disability walked using a child’s crutch. \n‘I had never thought that they were homeless, as I had seen them get out of the car and wait around before walking off. It’s not like there’s any bus routes on the road to wait for.’ \nCambridge City Council has been approached for comment. \nInspector Nick Skipworth told metro.co.uk: ‘We know that not all those who beg are homeless and not all homeless people beg. However, organised activity such as this is a priority for us as we aware this group targets other cities. \n‘We are working closely with partner agencies including Cambridge City Council to tackle anti-social behaviour and meet weekly to discuss issues which include begging and associated criminality. \n‘We would always encourage members of the public who want to help genuine homelessness to donate to Cambridge Street Aid or one of the city’s many charities and organisations instead of giving cash directly to those on the street.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:37:54.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
