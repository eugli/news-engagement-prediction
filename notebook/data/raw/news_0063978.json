Peterman went through a redshirt season with the Vols in 2012 and started twice in 12 games over the 2013 and 2014 seasons, before transferring to Pittsburgh. \n“Dobbs is a dual threat,\" Gruden said in an ESPN press release. \"He’s from a no-huddle offense. He can really create plays with his legs. He played some of his best football when the team was behind and when the game was on the line. Tennessee senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs (Photo: Jim Brown, USA TODAY Sports) \n\"He brought the Volunteers back to win from double-digit deficits more than any guy in the country. He’s a great kid, very intelligent, and I think he caught peoples’ attention at the Senior Bowl.” \nAs a graduate-transfer at Pitt, Peterman started all 13 games for the Panthers in 2016, completing 60.5 percent of his passes for 2,855 yards and 27 touchdowns, the most by a Pitt quarterback since 2003. \n\"Coach (Pat) Narduzzi at Pitt recruited Kirk Cousins to Michigan State and I heard he compares Peterman to Cousins,\" Gruden said. \"He’s a pocket-passer. They run a very creative offense at Pitt and this is the one guy who beat Clemson – and they did it on the road. He’s one of the most improved quarterbacks in the country this year.” \nDobbs, running an offense in 2016 that averaged 36.4 points and 443.7 yards per game, led Tennessee to three bowl wins during his career. Peterman led an offense that set Pitt records by averaging 40.92 points per game. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
