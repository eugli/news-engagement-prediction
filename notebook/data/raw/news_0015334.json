He followed the game on his cell phone. He broke into a sweat when the game tied. \n\"It feels surreal,\" to have missed the most action-packed minutes of the game, Ruffini said. \"I'm trying to convince myself that this is the experience I need to watch a record-winning championship for Tom Brady.\" \nThe New England Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, 34-28, in the first Super Bowl to go into overtime. \nThe fan fretting recalled that of Buffalo Bills fans who headed for the exits before their team staged the greatest comeback in NFL history against the Houston Oilers in an AFC playoff game in 1993. The Bills came back from a 32-point deficit to defeat the Houston Oilers, 41-38, in Buffalo's Rich Stadium. \nHowever, Patriots fans who didn't fold up their tents when the word \"blowout\" was being bandied about were rewarded. \nWhen her Patriots won, Cindy Kerr high-dived everyone around her. \n\"I feel like $1 million,\" the Newport, R.I., resident said. \"You never turn your back on Tom Brady, you never know what he's going to do.\" \nShe said she nearly had a heart attack before the Patriots clawed their way back. \n\"We came all the way from Newport, Rhode Island to watch them win, and they did.\" \nRyan McNair was ambivalent about his trip to the Super Bowl to support his Falcons. \n\"I feel horribly defeated right now,\" he said. \"I came all the way from New York to watch this watch them lose.\" \nHe said it was a great game. He said it was history-making. But that didn't change the fact that his team lost, after coming close to winning their first Super Bowl in the franchise's 51-year history \n\"We've got to get a defense,\" he said, shaking his head as he jogged to a car in an effort to make his late-night flight back to New York.
