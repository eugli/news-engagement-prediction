During his confirmation hearing, Pruitt refused to recuse himself from the eight ongoing lawsuits Oklahoma has filed against the EPA. \nStill, the Trump administration does not want to wait for Congress to act. This week, the White House is readying executive actions seeking to undo Obama-era rules meant to curtail water pollution and the release of greenhouse gases, the Washington Post reported \nGoing into more detail than he did during his speech, Pruitt told the The Wall Street Journal in his first interview as EPA administrator that he expects to quickly withdraw the US from Clean Power Plan, Obama's landmark proposal for curbing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. \n“There’s a very simple reason why this needs to happen,” Pruitt said. “Because the courts have seriously called into question the legality of those rules.” \nBut the Supreme Court, in 2007, has already ruled that EPA is obligated to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. \nPruitt delivered his remarks in the agency's ornate Rachel L. Carson Great Hall, named after the scientist who authored the 1962 book Silent Spring, which kickstarted the US environmental movement and ultimately led to the creation of the EPA eight years later. \nBehind the cameras were security personnel from the Department of Homeland Security — whose presence at the headquarters, according to two EPA employees, was a first for the agency. Pruitt is expected to ask for an around-the-clock security detail as administrator, according to E&E News . \nAt the end of his speech, Pruitt quoted another famous environmentalist — John Muir, the 19th century activist and founder of the Sierra Club — as a way to reassure employees that his business-friendly approach is compatible with the agency's goal of environmental protection. \n“Everybody needs beauty as well as bread,” Pruitt said, quoting Muir. \nThe current head of the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, objected to the name drop. \n“John Muir is rolling over in his grave,” Brune said in a statement after the speech, “at the notion of someone as toxic to the environment as Scott Pruitt taking over the EPA.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:25:47.281+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
