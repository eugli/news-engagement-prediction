However, the PM in his statement submits that the SC cannot act as an investigating agency under Article 184 (3). \nThe PM submits that the material relied upon by Ahmed cannot be regarded as evidence and cannot form basis of his disqualification as an MNA unless it is ruled admissible in evidence and formally proved against the PM in consonance with the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.. \n“The petitioner desires that the authority under Article 184(3)… be exercised by this hon’ble court with little or no regard to the requirements of due process and fair trial. This clearly is not the mandate of Article 184(3),” it adds. \nThe PM objects that Ahmed has already availed adequate constitutional and statutory remedies before the National Assembly speaker and the Election Commission of Pakistan and he is, therefore, stopped from invoking the constitutional Jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. \nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 19 th , 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:45:13.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
