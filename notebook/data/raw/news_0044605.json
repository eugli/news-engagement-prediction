According to ESPN.com , Huggins said it felt as though someone had hit him in the back, which caused him to go down. The 63-year-old coach further described the feeling and also the mechanics behind the defibrillator: \n\"That's what happened when I fell down before; you stand up, you get lightheaded. ...

The WVU alum is in the midst of his 10th season coaching the Mountaineers and his 32nd year overall as a Division I head coach after previous stints at Akron, Cincinnati and Kansas State.
