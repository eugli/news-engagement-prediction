She dangled more than 70 stories up in the air, stopped from absolutely certain death only by the grip of someone she had to trust a whole lot. That person was infamous rooftopper and daredevil Oleg Cricket , who has appeared in this space before for ridiculous rooftop feats on skyscrapers across the world. He held Odintcova from the edge of the 1,004-foot-tall Cayan Tower, which was a captured in a video that will make your stomach do flips. The online attention garnered by her stunt has led the Russian model to be dragged in front of police, according to a report from the Sun . Though, her punishment wasn't too severe. She has been forced to sign a statement saying she'll never try something like this again. \"The actions of the Russian woman put her life at risk,\" said Major General Halil Ibragim Al-Mansuri of the Dubai police. Odintcova countered that police should be thanking her for \"highlighting the lack of security of the Cayan Tower,\" according to the Sun . Oh. Of course. No word yet if she had to pinky swear and/or spit into her palm before signing the totally binding statement.
