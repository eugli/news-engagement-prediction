(Jeff Roberson/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   4:48 PM \nVice President Mike Pence visited a Jewish cemetery on Wednesday where vandals recently toppled hundreds of tombstones, decrying anti-Semitism during the stop. \nPence swung by Chesed Shel Emeth Society, a historic Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Mo., that suffered extensive vandalism over the weekend amidst a rash of anti-Semitic threats since President Trump's November election victory. \n\"There is no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice or violence or anti-Semitism,\" Pence declared at the graveyard, standing alongside Missouri's first Republican Jewish Gov. Eric Greitens.

(Robert Cohen/AP) \nThe unannounced visit came after he mentioned the cemetery in an earlier speech, and just one day after Trump himself decried anti-Semitism after avoiding a direct answer on the topic in recent weeks. \nTrump took a similar tone on Tuesday, a reversal from defensive comments he'd made earlier. Vandals damaged over 150 headstones at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in St. Louis over the weekend. (KSDK) \n\"Anti-Semitism is horrible and it's going to stop and it has to stop,\" Trump said during a visit to the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture on Tuesday, calling it \"horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.\" \n\"On Monday morning America awoke to discover that nearly 200 tombstones were toppled in a nearby Jewish graveyard,\" Pence said. \"We condemn this vile act of vandalism and those that perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms.\" Pence visits the desecrated Jewish cemetery in St. Louis alongside Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens. (KMOV) \nThe weekend cemetery destruction came amid a rash of recent bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers. More than 50 centers have been targeted in recent months. \nPence's visit is the latest Trump administration outreach to the Jewish community after a rocky stretch. \nTrump made no mention of Jews in a statement for International Holocaust Remembrance Day, an omission the Anti-Defamation League called \"puzzling and troubling.\" And Trump didn't directly answer recent questions about anti-Semitism on two separate occasions, highlighting his Jewish family members and \"so many friends\" in one response and cutting off a questioner in another, telling the reporter that he was \"the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:19:05.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
