Isaac, known from his popular turn as pilot Poe Dameron in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its upcoming sequel The Last Jedi , will star as the titular Danish price, alongside Key & Peele’s Keegan-Michael Key, who will make his New York stage debut as Horatio. \nHamlet marks a return to the stage for Issac, who had previously starred in productions of The Two Gentleman of Verona and Romeo and Juliet at the Public Theater’s Free Shakespeare in the Park back in 2005 and 2007, respectively, just as his career in television and film was getting underway. Along with his appearances at the Public, Isaac has also featured in several productions at the Manhattan Theater Club, but Hamlet will mark his first time back on stage since 2011. \nIsaac himself represents a continuation of a long tradition of the Star Wars franchise of recruiting stage actors, which arguably began with Alec Guinness, and has been continued through with the casting of Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and Max von Sydow. \nAs the Times notes , the Isaac-led production of Hamlet was originally planned to run at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn last summer, but left the theater due to creative differences between director Sam Gold (who won a Tony Award for his musical Fun Home in 2015) and the Polonsky Shakespeare Center’s artistic director Jeffrey Horowitz. \nHamlet will run at the Public Theater from June 20th through September 3rd this summer. Tickets start at $95, plus fees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:22:58.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
