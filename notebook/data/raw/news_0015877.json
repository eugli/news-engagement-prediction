The HSUS, its lawyers write, “is exercising its rights under [the 2009 settlement] and intends to take further action unless USDA agrees to reconsider this bizarre reversal of the agency’s longstanding policy” of making inspection records and others publicly available. \nThe animal organization’s letter notes that under the terms of the 2009 settlement, the two parties, HSUS and USDA, now have 30 days to settle their differences. After that, HSUS can ask the court to reopen the lawsuit. \nA spokeswoman for the USDA did not in the course of three hours return an email and a call requesting comment. \nThe HSUS letter also argues that the USDA’s actions violate laws governing the electronic release of data under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the laws requires agencies to “make available for public inspection… [By] electronic means” all FOIA requests that it releases to anyone and that it determines are likely to be asked for again, by others. When they were public, many of the USDA’s inspection reports, especially those of troubled facilities, were accessed repeatedly by a number of different users. \nThe lawsuit that was settled in 2009 was brought by the HSUS in 2005, after USDA refused to release under FOIA annual reports about animals in biomedical research labs. The 2009 settlement stipulated that the agency must promptly and publicly post those reports from 2009 to 2013. It does not address the years after 2013, nor does it address the many other kinds of documents that were scrubbed from USDA’s public database on Friday. For instance, inspection reports of animal facilities were not covered in the settlement. \nKathleen Conlee, the vice president for animal research at HSUS, concedes that the settlement was limited to records through 2013 , but adds: “The arguments still apply: Taxpayers have a right to know what animals are being used, how many, and whether they experience pain and distress.” She also noted that personal identifying information is already redacted from what until Friday were the publicly posted reports. \nThe scrubbed documents detail inspections, animal censuses, enforcement actions, and annual reports on about 7,800 facilities, including some 1,100 research labs, where animals that are protected under the Animal Welfare Act are kept. Other facilities covered in the reports include zoos, circuses and animal transporters. \nThe removal of the documents on Friday prompted an outcry from animal welfare advocates. \"With this announcement, transparency has not just been limited—it is has been eliminated,\" said Eric Kleiman, a research consultant to the Animal Welfare Institute in Washington, D.C. \nUSDA said that the blacking out of the documents was a result of its “commitment to being transparent, remaining responsive to our stakeholders’ informational needs, and maintaining the privacy rights of individuals.” It also stated that the decision to remove the records from public view resulted from a year-long “comprehensive review,” and noted that individuals will continue to be able to access records through Freedom of Information Act requests. Those can take months or years to receive responses. \n“I would certainly agree that protection of personal information is of utmost importance, especially given the rich history of targeting the individuals involved in animal research,” said Matthew Bailey, the president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, which defends the use of animals in research,in a statement. “However, this change also makes it more time consuming, although not impossible, for organizations like FBR to analyze trends in animal use in research.” \nWayne Pacelle, the president and CEO of the HSUS, stated in this blog today that Brian Klippenstein, the executive director of a group called Protect the Harvest , is leading the transition team at the USDA. The group on its website lists among its objectives informing “America’s consumers, businesses and decision-makers about the threats posed by animal rights groups and anti-farming extremists.” \nProtect the Harvest did not immediately return an emailed request for comment. \nUpdate , 8:06 p.m., 02/06/2017: This story has been updated to clarify the details of the 2009 settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:21:18.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
