He’s from, Lodi, N.J., which is just across the Hudson River from Midtown Manhattan. \nGuarantano is proud to be from New Jersey, but his parents and sister recently moved to Atlanta and live just 10 minutes — depending on Atlanta’s notorious traffic, obviously — from the sparkling new stadium where Tennessee will open its 2017 season. \nThat’s certainly done nothing to diminish Guarantano’s desire to outlast junior Quinten Dormady , sophomore Sheriron Jones and freshman Will McBride for the starting spot. \nAnd Guarantano — the nation’s No. 1 dual-threat quarterback prospect in the 2016 industry-generated 247Sports Composite — already wanted the job bad enough. (Photo: Saul Young, Knoxville News Sentinel) \n“I was watching a Georgia Tech game last week and I was just thinking, ‘Wow,’” Guarantano said. “I have a lot family in Georgia. My parents and my sister just recently moved down there, and they’re like 10 minutes away from the stadium. \n“Being able to have the opportunity to have my first game right in front of my family and have people come down and stay at my mom’s house and all that stuff, I’ve thought about it and I can’t wait. I can’t wait. I’m so excited.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nDespite enrolling at Tennessee with sky-high expectations, Guarantano insisted he knew he was likely going to redshirt last season, and that he was fine with it. He embraced it, actually. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound quarterback with tremendous athleticism and a powerful right arm attached himself to Dobbs, the dual-threat dynamo who served as the Vols’ starter the past four seasons and recently performed well in the Senior Bowl. \n“I learned a lot,” Guarantano said. “I learned the pressure of being an SEC quarterback, the pressure of being a Tennessee quarterback. It all comes into account. You can be the most hated guy, and you can be the most loved guy. But [Dobbs] did a great job over his career, and I thank him for helping me out and taking the time out that he did for me and making me a better player and person at the same time.” \nGuarantano said it was no coincidence that he was next to Dobbs in so many camera shots of the senior quarterback between offensive series last season. \n“That was me just making sure that he saw the same exact thing that he saw, ‘cause I have a lot better view from the sideline,” Guarantano said. “It’s just making sure that we’re all straight, that we’re getting the best opportunity and we’re getting the best play call possible. And just being able to hear him go over defenses and his analysis of what he saw, that helped me throughout the game. \n“I would go in after the game and watch the film and I would say, ‘This is what we he was talking about,’ or, ‘This is why he did the things that he did.’” \nGuarantano has never lacked confidence — something that’s obvious when you watch him walk into any room — but the young quarterback described redshirting last season as something akin to a humbling experience that will help him moving forward.

I learned the offense. Practice was a big part for me. I kind of took practice like the games. But coming into this year, it’s a lot different. I’m definitely going into more film, thinking, ‘What can I do on my footwork,’ just trying to get better each every day, and just knowing that if I have the chance to play and if I have the chance to start, that I’m going to take that chance and run away with it as much as possible. \n“I’m very excited. I can’t wait for spring ball, and I know it’s gonna be a great competition.” \nMake no mistake, though: Guarantano was crystal clear when asked if his goal was to win that competition and be Tennessee’s starting quarterback next season. \n“Absolutely,” he said. “I’m trying.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
