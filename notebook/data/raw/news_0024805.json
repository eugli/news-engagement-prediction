According to a new report from the Associated Press , a person close to the Grammy nomination process speaking on the condition of anonymity revealed that Macklemore & Ryan Lewis voluntarily withheld the second studio effort from being submitted to potentially be recognized for Best Rap Album and maybe more. \nAlthough The Heist earned the group a pair of Billboard No. 1 hits, a platinum-certified album and four Grammys (the aforementioned Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song and Best New Artist), their big Grammy night almost never happened as the committee initially tried to stick them in the pop category due to the uncharacteristic commercial success as far as Hip Hop releases are concerned. Macklemore Says He Had “An Unfair Advantage Due To Race” At The Grammys \nFeaturing songs like “White Privilege II” — an open letter diatribe on race issues in the United States — and guest appearances from cultural heroes such as KRS-One, DJ Premier and Chance the Rapper, This Unruly Mess I Made was a precursor to the duo’s recent Grammy self-exile. In the HipHopDX review of the album , the group was cited for waiving “their rights as America’s token rap stars to be leveled with the more commoner rappers who work just as hard and sell less.” \nAnd sell less it did. According to Nielsen Music, it moved 382,000 units (based on a combination of album sales, song sales and on-demand audio streams) in comparison to The Heist ‘s combined 4.3 million units. \nRepresentatives for the rap group and the Grammys didn’t reply to the Associated Press emails seeking a comment. Most likely they were busy hunting for the leak to plug. Subscribe to DX Newsletter Get The Most Important Stories Of The Day Straight To Your Inbox Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
