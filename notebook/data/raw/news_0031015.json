Advertisement \nMs Ting told the court the she had wanted her mother to travel from Fiji to be with her and her newborn, but Radradra had not filled out the forms to help her get a visa. \nAfter her mother rang her on the phone, the court heard, Ms Ting and Radradra had an argument in the bedroom. \nRadradra, the court heard, was upset about the length of the conversation. \n\"I just grabbed the phone and smashed the phone on the wall ... I told him 'he's a liar',\" Ms Ting said. \n\"He stood up and he punched me.\" \nMs Ting told the court she started crying and locked herself in the bathroom. She overheard Radradra call a pastor and ask him to come the home. \nTranslating from Fijian, Ms Ting told the court that Radradra told the pastor: \"I used my hands on her\". \nThe pastor arrived, the court heard, and talked to the pair together and they read a Bible verse before he left. \nMs Ting said the second alleged assault occurred during an argument about bullying on Facebook the following year. \nShe said she threatened to call the police but Radradra was crying, apologising and promising not to hurt her again. \nFive witnesses are expected to give evidence at the hearing.
