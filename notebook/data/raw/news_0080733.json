(Photo: William Everett/The Republic)\n23 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A suspect was in custody Monday following a shooting at a Best Buy in Avondale, officials said.\nAt least two people were hurt when gunshots broke out at the store near 99th Avenue and McDowell Road just after noon, according to Officer Jaret Redfearn, an Avondale police spokesman.\nRedfearn said two gunshot victims were taken to hospitals, and police had a suspect in custody at the scene.\nHe said police think the suspected shooter acted alone.\nFernando Perez, 20, told The Arizona Republic that he and his friend were in the Best Buy shopping for supplies for some speakers when they heard what sounded like a chase and saw a man wearing all black running after a woman.\n\"After that, we just heard the gunfire,\" Perez said. \"Then we just ran out of the back door and went all the way to (Raising) Cane's.\"\nTrudy Frias and her family pulled up to the scene shortly after, unaware of what happened. Frias said that when they parked, they could only see police cars.\nHer husband, Larry, jumped up on the trailer their truck was pulling while she used his binoculars to try see what was going on.\n\"I saw them wheeling a guy out of the Best Buy,\" Frias said. \"They had an air mask on him.\"\nFrias then said she saw a second person who was also on a stretcher being wheeled out to awaiting ambulances.\nReturn to azcentral.com for more information.", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2mx1pi5&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b87f1c3a58e9e954dfef60e623e1fc317ba6a88/c=1-0-639-480&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/27/Phoenix/Phoenix/636238040328291206-IMG-3454.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2mx1pi5&text=2%20hurt%20in%20shooting%20at%20Best%20Buy%20in%20Avondale%3B%20suspect%20in%20custody&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/02/27/Phoenix/Phoenix/636238040328291206-IMG-3454.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/27/Phoenix/Phoenix/636238040328291206-IMG-3454.JPG"], "published": "2017-02-28T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:12:36.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
