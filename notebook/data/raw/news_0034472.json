Officials said the powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 caused an undetermined number of casualties, damaged roads and buildings, including the airport, and knocked power out.

ADVERTISEMENT \nNearly 100 aftershocks have been felt, officials said. Evacuation centers accommodated wary residents overnight, but many returned home Saturday, Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said, adding that officials were continuing to assess the damage in Surigao and outlying towns. \nProvincial information officer Mary Jul Escalante was being interviewed by ABS-CBN TV network when another aftershock struck. \n“Oh sir, there’s an aftershock,” she said. “I’m shaking, we have a phobia now.” \nAt least six people were killed, mostly after being struck by falling debris and concrete walls, provincial disaster-response official Gilbert Gonzales said. At least 126 others were injured in Surigao, where the quake knocked out power and forced the closure of the domestic airport due to deep cracks in its runway, officials said. \nSeveral buildings, including a state college, a hotel and a shopping mall, were damaged in the city, located about 700 kilometers (430 miles) southeast of Manila. Surigao was placed under a state of calamity to allow faster release of emergency funds, the provincial police chief, Senior Supt. Anthony Maghari, said by phone. \nTV footage showed army troops and other rescuers pulling out the body of a man from the concrete rubble of a damaged house while relatives wept. \nIn Surigao’s downtown area, the facade of a number of buildings were heavily cracked, their glass windows shattered with canopies and debris falling on parked cars on the street below. \nRoads had visible cracks in the coastal city and a bridge collapsed in an outlying town, officials said. \n“The shaking was so strong I could hardly stand,” coast guard personnel Rayner Neil Elopre said by phone. \nVillage leaders asked residents to move to a school building on higher ground, Elopre said, pausing briefly during a mild aftershock while talking on the phone. \nPolice officer Jimmy Sarael said he, his wife, and two children embraced each other until the shaking eased. They later moved to the moonlit grounds outside the provincial capitol complex to join more than 1,000 jittery residents, he said. \nThe last major earthquake that struck Surigao, an impoverished region also dealing with a communist insurgency, was in the 1879, Solidum said. A magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people on the northern island of Luzon in 1990. \nAmid the calamity, the military appealed to New People’s Army guerrillas not to disrupt rescue and rehabilitation work. \n“We urge you not to attack our soldiers,” military spokesman Col. Edgard Arevalo said. \nThe Philippines sits in the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanoes are common. * * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:14:01.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
