He wants to be a non-political celebrity personality. #Milo \n— Richard 🥛 Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 21, 2017 The right getting praise for taking a stance against pedophiles and anti-semitism – the bar is at an all time low. \n— billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 21, 2017 I wonder how many people have reported Milo Yannopoulos to ICE since he’s now an unemployed freeloader in this country. \n— Jeremy Bolaños (@JeremyBolanos) February 21, 2017 Milo resigns from Breitbart after he was caught meeting the editorial standards at Breitbart \n— Ned Resnikoff (@resnikoff) February 21, 2017 Reminder— Milo just resigned from the alt-right website that used to be run by Donald Trump’s current chief strategist. \n— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) February 21, 2017 Milo is almost bigger than Breitbart at this point. \nHim leaving Breitbart is virtually irrelevant. pic.twitter.com/YPuJqeqES9 \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 21, 2017 Congratulations to Milo on his new job at Fusion. \n— Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) February 21, 2017 Milo is leaving to spend more time with his Pepe. \n— Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) February 21, 2017 really want to make sure the name milo is restored to its rightful owner pic.twitter.com/I8D5jI991d \n— Melody Joy Kramer (@mkramer) February 21, 2017 Milo thinks “don’t be a huge asshole” is an oppressive social restriction, I guess? \n— nilay patel (@reckless) February 21, 2017 The snippet of Milo’s press conference I watched said the U.S. is repressive on free speech, which is funny coming from a Brit. \n— Matt Ford (@fordm) February 21, 2017 \nThere were some, though, who still came to Yiannopoulos’s defense. 43. You see Milo is what happens when liberalism takes hold. He is a product of liberal corrosion.
