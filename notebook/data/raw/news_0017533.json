Some Fed officials like Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren have previously expressed concern about a potential bubble in that sector. \nUBS strategists Stephen Caprio and Matthew Mish dug up another note of caution in the survey, this one from a special question on delinquencies. \"R ising post-election optimism was balanced out by households stating they were more likely to default on a loan over the next 12 months,\" they said.\" \n\"Bottom line, there is clear potential for winners and losers post-election, rather than all winners.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T19:18:12.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
