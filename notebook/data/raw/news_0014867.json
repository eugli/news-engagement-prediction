A total of 12 people have now been detained by police over tree-felling protests in Sheffield since November.\nCrump, an academic who is facing trial after being arrested in November , told the Guardian: “This was a carefully orchestrated campaign by the police and Amey [the council’s contractors].\n\n“The police are being used as Amey’s private security company. There was at least nine policemen and two meat wagons there at one point. It was a completely peaceful protest but the police definitely ramped up the situation. They turned what was a peaceful protest into a mass arrest.”\nCrump, who jokingly referred to himself and Teal as “the Posh and Becks of Sheffield trees”, said the police were called after protesters stepped inside a cordon placed around a tree earmarked for felling.\n“Two meat wagons turned up and they were warned and read their rights and eventually they were led away and put into the wagons,” he said. “Police then pretty much blocked off the whole street and as we speak they’re cutting the tree down.”\nBefore the arrests, Teal posted on social media that there was a “good turnout” of protesters who were “patiently waiting like good British citizens”. She tweeted: \nAlison Teal (@alisonclareteal) Patiently waiting like good British citizens do. How long before they fell the tree and pedestrians can pass? pic.twitter.com/lY6lDPNK8U \nFebruary 6, 2017 Dave Dillner, chair of the Sheffield Tree Action Groups, said campaigners were outraged at the arrest of Teal, and said his group had added 22 new members since the news of her detention broke.\n“My gut feeling is that the arrests will go on and this will not be the end of it,” he said. “People are really angry because Alison Teal is an extremely hard-working councillor, an extremely popular councillor and a strong supporter of the aims of the Sheffield Tree Action Groups.”\nLast month a 70-year-old retired professor and a 72-year-old retired teacher were told they were no longer being prosecuted after being arrested during a protest on Rustlings Road in the city in November. \n\nThe former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg described that operation – during which residents were woken at dawn and asked to move their cars – as being more like a well-planned anti-terror raid than a morning of tree maintenance. \nThe fight for Sheffield’s trees has its roots in a £2bn private finance initiative (PFI) deal signed by the Labour-run council in 2012. The contractor Amey is tasked with maintaining the city’s 36,000 roadside trees as part of a road maintenance agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:20:28.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
