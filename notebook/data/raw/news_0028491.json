(Supplied: Undoolya Station) \nMr Hayes said everyone on the station was supportive of the modernisation. \n\"I just like them for the ease of maintenance on them. The only thing that worries me is we're running electricity into water and we've always been told not to. \n\"That's a concern, I don't understand that yet but I'll get my head around that and once I do I'll be right. Solar power offers new opportunities \nHe also see the versatility of the solar units for other things. \n\"You can go there and if need be you can hook a generator up to them, fire them up in the evening. It can run all night until you've run out of fuel, and you don't have to go back the next day and flick any switches. It will automatically flick into solar for you, which is great for me so far.\" \nMr Hayes said the most recent one he had pulled out was an old mono windmill, which was very rare. \n\"You don't see too many of them around. \n\"The mill is still there, and I pulled the mono gear out and just replaced it with the solar.\" \nHe said some of the mills he had been taking out would date back to the late 40s and early 50s which his grandfather put up. \n\"With some of them we've been cutting down and dropping on the ground and cutting them up and using the steel into yards and stuff. \n\"And it just seems bloody strange coming up to a bore with no mill there anymore — you'd nearly get lost\" \nThe station hopes to change all the windmills to solar eventually, as well as other aspects of the property. \n\"I've got my auto drafting for drafting my steers — that's running on solar. \n\"I'm actually toying with the idea of making a bugle yard with automated drafting in it running on solar panels. I'm thinking of different things to use solar for,\" Mr Hayes said. \n\"I also wouldn't mind trialling a calf cradle that runs on solar, electric over hydraulic using solar, so we're trying different things.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:51:17.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
