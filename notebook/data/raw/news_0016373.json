While vaporizers are touted as 'safe', health experts warn we still don't have enough evidence to say that for certain. But a new set of experiments performed in the UK have shown lung tissue is barely affected at all by e-cigarettes - compared to the crippling affect cigarette smoke has one our organs. Lungs exposed to tobacco suffered changes in 123 genes - mutating cells in a way that creates fertile ground for heart disease, inflammation, and even tumor growth. Meanwhile just two genes were affected in lungs exposed to e-cigarette vapor. Research by the British American Tobacco R&D Center found lungs exposed to e-cigarettes suffered two gene mutations - compared to the 123 genes changed by exposure to tobacco The products still carry a danger - two genes is more than none, and a study last week e-cigarette users have a higher risk of heart disease than non-users, due to higher levels of inflammation. However, lead author Anisha Banerjee of the British American Tobacco R&D Center insists it is time we universally acknowledge the safety of vaporizers in contrast with cigarettes. To investigate the impact of e-cigarettes versus cigarettes, the researchers used a groundbreaking new kind of lung model. Using cultured human airway cells, they managed to build 3D models that mimic the precise structure of human lung tissue. These models were exposed to two kinds of smoke - cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor from Vype ePen, a commercially available e-cigarette. To mimic human smoking, the cells were exposed to the substance for five minutes at a time, with a 30-minute break in between, over a period of two hours and 20 minutes.
