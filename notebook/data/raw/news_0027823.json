More than 400 soldiers had been deployed in and around the city centre. The build-up to his address was characterised by taunting and violence which, once quelled, was dismissed by a giggling Zuma. Picture: epa Related Links \nPolitical parties will debate President Jacob Zuma’s State of the Nation address on Tuesday and Wednesday. \nThe president’s Sona was again marred by fisticuffs, swearing, heckling, and walkouts. \nThe stringent security measures which were carried out in and around Parliament for the Sona were, however, dismissed by the country’s security agencies as “a perception”. \nPolice were highly visible, positioned as they were in Cape Town’s central business district in groups of about 10 every few metres, milling around the area and at entry points to it. \nMore manpower was deployed inside the parliamentary precinct, including plain-clothed officers and members of the intelligence community. \nBut those in charge of the security plan claim the numbers have been exaggerated and nothing was extraordinary about this year’s Sona security plan. \nThe DA has approached the courts, seeking a declaration that Thursday’s deployment of SA National Defence Force members to the parliamentary precinct for non-ceremonial purposes was unconstitutional and unlawful. The party added that it was taking legal action to ensure that the gradual securitisation and militarisation of Parliament was halted once and for all.“The presence of the national defence force, in a way that far exceeded a mere ceremonial role, can never be tolerated again,” said DA leader Mmusi Maimane.He said the presence of armed military police with live ammunition on the precinct of Parliament was untenable in a constitutional democracy.“Our court action is [being taken] to ensure that the integrity of Parliament is restored and that we can make the work of Parliament about the people of South Africa once more.“It ought to be an institution in which we can fight for the poor and the excluded, an institution which vigorously holds power to account,” he added.National defence force spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini declined to comment on whether there were military personnel on the precinct besides those who were there for ceremonial purposes.He referred the questions to Parliament, saying it was dealing with the matter. \nEFF MPs will miss the Sona debate as they were automatically suspended for five working days following their violent ejection from the National Assembly. \nDA MPs, who walked out before Zuma delivered his speech, said on Sunday that they would attend the debate. \nThe one-and-a-half-hour-long speech was “weak, uninspiring and racially divisive, devoid of any new ideas on how to free our young people from the shackles of joblessness and hopelessness,” the party said. \nCope would be participating as well, leader Mosiuoa Lekota said on Monday, even though the party said Zuma’s speech carried little weight and was just smoke and mirrors. \nZuma focused on economic transformation, university fees, land, and corruption. \nHe said his “caring” government would look into the prospect of raising the National Student Financial Aid Scheme threshold to above R122 000, in phases. \nStudents from families earning below R600 000 a year would continue to have their tuition fee increases covered. \nHe called for arable land to be returned to blacks. It would be “difficult, if not impossible”, to achieve true reconciliation until the land question was resolved, he said. \nZuma would reply to the debate on Thursday.
