Earlier this month, Zhejiang shut down its live poultry markets. Some cities in Jiangsu have banned live poultry trade as well. \nIn addition, Guangdong province has suspended the sale of poultry from high-risk areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi, and ordered each city to restrict the live poultry trade. \nChina’s Guangzhou has third of live poultry markets contaminated with bird flu, survey finds \nIn Guangzhou, where H7N9 was detected at 30 per cent of live poultry markets, sales have been suspended since Thursday, with the ban remaining in place until the end of the month. \nThe order appears to have been enforced to an unprecedented extent in the city, where residents have a strong preference for buying live chickens over frozen ones. \nTaiwan culls 150,000 poultry following bird flu outbreak across island \n“It is really strict this year. Vendors secretly sold live chickens when there was a similar ban before, but not this time,” one vegetable vendor at a wet market in Guangzhou’s downtown Yuexiu district said. \nGuangzhou resident Zhang ­Jiehong, 47, said fear of catching the virus stopped her from going to a wet market unless absolutely necessary. \n“I’ve caught a cold and I have elderly people at home. I don’t want to catch something in the market,” Zhang said. \nThe commission said contact with H7N9-infected poultry or exposure at a market with live poultry were high risk factors and shutting down such markets had proved effective. \nAdditional reporting by Mimi Lau ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:35:19.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
