And with Dalvin Cook moving on to the NFL, both will likely get an opportunity to showcase their skills in 2017.\nFarrell’s take: This is an easy one as there have not been many instances over the years of programs signing a pair of five-star running backs. Akers is the workhorse and between-the-tackles runner with sneaky outside speed, while Laborn has that amazing speed around the corner and can catch the ball. This could be a Darren McFadden - Felix Jones or Ronnie Brown - Cadillac Williams situation.\nALABAMA Najee Harris The skinny: While the Crimson Tide will be returning a loaded backfield with Bo Scarbrough , Damien Harris , Joshua Jacobs and B.J. Emmons , plus the running ability of quarterback Jalen Hurts , they’ll also add Harris, the No. 1 running back, and Robinson into the competition.\nFarrell’s take: Harris could be one of the best running backs in a decade if he puts it all together. Let's not overlook Robinson, as he would be the premier back in numerous classes. But the competition is fierce and it could take as much patience as it takes talent to make it at Alabama for this duo.\nOKLAHOMA Trey Sermon The skinny: With Joe Mixon and Samaje Perine both leaving Norman for the NFL, the Sooners needed to reload the backfield. They did just that by adding Sermon, the No. 10 running back, and Brooks, the No. 12 running back. Both should have an opportunity to earn early playing time.\nFarrell’s take: Sermon is a big, physical back who will be the downhill guy, while Brooks has more straight-line speed and wiggle. It will be hard to match the success of Perine and Mixon, but this is a great 1-2 punch for the Sooners.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ahu1kipdvpml5wfmszhe)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fqj5mscfzavwiynzjjmc)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dyrbo7sbgg26alholyq7)", "https://www.yahoo.com/national-signing-day-live-235419491.html?format=embed&region=US&lang=en-US&site=sports&player_autoplay=true", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/xzfi3mhe4xmqz0axdvtx)", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/vftbid7i8mianvslhojt", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dni2brume58hrjnybxoy)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dyrbo7sbgg26alholyq7", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/xzfi3mhe4xmqz0axdvtx", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fqj5mscfzavwiynzjjmc", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/ahu1kipdvpml5wfmszhe", "https://res-1.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/vftbid7i8mianvslhojt)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dni2brume58hrjnybxoy"], "published": "2017-02-14T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:31:53.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
