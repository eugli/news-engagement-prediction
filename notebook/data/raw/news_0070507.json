Heading east from Tijuana and San Diego are the vast expanses of Sonora and Chihuahua deserts, via Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, before reaching the Colorado river delta, and finally the cities of Matamoros and Brownsville.\nJim Watson drove nearly 1,750 miles along dirt roads, through deserts and vast amounts of farm lands along the US side of the border beginning in San Diego, California and ending in San Antonio, Texas. Watson’s Mexican colleagues Yuri Cortes, and Guillermo Arias took a parallel journey on the Mexican side, beginning in Baha California and finishing in Tamaulipas.\n\nI felt that many Americans had no idea what the border in the US really looked like, and I myself had no complete vision of it. I hoped US Border Patrol public affairs would be able to provide me with embeds along the the way, but the best they could do was let the agents in the areas know I was coming and that I could be there shooting pictures; Jim Watson \nUS Mexico Border Map Watson continues: “I quickly began to see, once starting the project, that there is already a wall. While it is not brick and mortar, a huge fence runs up and down the border in quite a few locations. That being said, there are gaps in the fence, and there are areas where there is nothing at all. In many locations the border is the river, or mountains, and a physical barrier would almost be nonsensical, but there are places that the border patrol mentioned that are now seeing high traffic because the fence is everywhere else. \n“It seems to me that the fence is not really needed to keep out illegal immigrants, they come to the US mainly by overstaying their visas. I would think the fence is important in the eyes of the border patrol for keeping out the drugs. The barrier slows down the contraband crossing the borders and also funnels it into locations the border patrol can reinforce their presence.”\nTijuana–San Diego \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People in Tijuana, Mexico, look over the border fence separating the beaches at Border Field state park Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nThis journey begins in Tijuana, in the Mexican state of Baja California, and in San Diego, in southern California.

The town itself was very striking in that it was seated right up to the border and seemed to have a fairly interactive life with its Mexico counterpart. Outside of town there were some rolling hills that made for good pictures as the border fence almost looked like the spin of a serpent going up and down with the landscape; Jim Watson \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A US Border Patrol agent parks on a hill top near the border fence in Nogales, Arizona Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images A US Border Patrol agent parks on a hill top near the border fence in Nogales, Arizona\n\nI have mixed feelings ... I feel angry against my own country sometimes. In Nogales I was followed by narco vehicles, and they sent me a kind of message to leave the area. I felt more secure on the US border than in Mexico, with the US police, and I did not feel safe with the Mexican federal police, which is incredible and sad, how is it possible? I decided to work very slowly in Nogales and to drive through the US and only cross back to Mexico to work on the project; Guillermo Arias \nPuerto Palomas–Columbus \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest View of the metal fence between US and Mexico taken in Puerto Palomas, Chihuahua Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images \nPuerto Palomas is an alternative border crossing 90 minutes west of El Paso.

El Paso used to be part of Mexico and 80% of residents are of Latino origin. Juárez, as locals call it, has become notorious for violence and a centre for drug trafficking controlled by the Juárez cartel.\nThe two cities, along with Las Cruces (in the neighboring state of New Mexico), form a combined international metropolitan area, sometimes called the Paso del Norte or El Paso–Juárez–Las Cruces, and is the second largest bi-national urban area on the US-Mexican border, with a combined population of over 2.5 million.\nThe future of the US-Mexican border: inside the 'split city' of El Paso-Juárez Read more \nThe border between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso is perhaps one of the most active frontiers, the transit of the car to the checkpoint took us more than an hour and a half.

Under the cover of the sunset and measuring each step inside the river, the woman crossed very slowly. It seemed that she carried lead on her feet and clung to her small baby. One false step and she could have lost her baby or both could have been dragged away by the water. However, she achieved her goal and was soon lost in the undergrowth of long-awaited American soil; Yuri Cortez \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two Mexican boys play guitars along the bank of Rio Bravo in Ojinaga Photograph: Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images International bridges \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view of the International bridge on the border in Piedras Negras Photograph: Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images \nWith the border now formed naturally by the widening river, the main crossing points are international bridges with checkpoints at each end.

You want and think you need proper border security for your nation, yet you also feel that everyone deserves a chance at prosperity; Jim Watson \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People cross the bridge on the US/Mexico border in Laredo Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nWatson continues: “I think many people can easily assume this is an American news story, but the effects of this can also be felt on the other side of the border. While many of the people I met along the way were adamant that a border fence or wall was needed, they also complained that that was not the real issue at hand. We already have a wall, they would say, it is the concerns about immigration that US President Donald Trump is putting on the country that is hurting things. \n“Business owner would say to me that sales are down because fewer people are coming across the border now. People are scared of being deported and that means they are not leaving their homes. It is the immigration process itself that needs to be repaired, they would say.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hats for sale at a shop next to the Laredo port of entry footbridge Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man walks along the international bridge in Nuevo Laredo Photograph: Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:35:55.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
