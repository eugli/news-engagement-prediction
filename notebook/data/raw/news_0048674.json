BMA The number of hospital beds has fallen since 1987 \nThe document states that “it provides evidence of the underlying cracks within the NHS, such as funding constraints, changes and increases in demand, disjointed care and workforce pressure.” \nA drop in the number of beds, delays in discharging older patients and the time it takes to make a bed ready for the next patient are all adding to the growing crisis. \nThe report also warns “there is a concern among doctors and other healthcare professionals that staff may feel pressured to free up beds. \n“In the worst-case scenario this can lead to patients being discharged before it is safe or appropriate to do so. \n“Not only does this compromise patients’ care at the time, but evidence suggests it leads to an increased chance of emergency readmission, which is something that has increased notably in recent years.” \nThe report shows: \nBetween 2006/7 and 2015/16, the number of overnight hospital beds has decreased by a fifth. \nIn 2000 there were an average of 3.8 beds per 1,000 people. This dropped to 2.4 beds by 2015; \nIn the first week of January 2017, almost three quarters of trusts had an occupancy rate of 95 per cent on at least one day of that week; \nThere is a mismatch between the supply and demand for beds which is causing bottlenecks in emergency departments. In November 2016, 15 per cent of patients – almost one in seven – spent more than four hours waiting for a hospital bed; \nThe pressures on mental health services are particularly acute. There has been a 44 per cent decrease in the number of mental health beds since 2000/01. Between March and October 2016 an average of 726 mental health patients had been given out of area placements each month. \nTrolley waits have risen since 2010 BMA Delayed discharges - known as 'bed blocking - is also on the rise \nLabour’s Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused the Government of trying “bury their heads in the sand” over the crisis. \nHe said: “This report from the BMA should be a wake-up call which Theresa May must not ignore. \n“Thanks to Tory mishandling of our NHS, patient numbers in hospitals are now routinely above the levels recommended for safety. \n“The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart Ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety.” \nA spokesperson for NHS Improvement said: “The NHS has been under real pressure this winter, as it copes with a surge in demand for emergency services the knock-on effects are felt throughout our hospitals. \n“Our hospitals are extremely busy but we are working tirelessly alongside providers to help them manage and to support more efficient use of the number of beds available.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:53:20.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
