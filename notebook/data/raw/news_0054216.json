Sobers was fond of a drink at the end of a day’s play.   \nAs often happens, the party “went a bit late” and Sobers found himself staring at an empty glass at around four in the morning. \nHe turned to his drinking partner and said “there’s no way I’m going to sleep”. \nInstead, he and former West Indian off-spinner Reg Scarlett returned to the Clarendon Court Hotel where the team was staying and started their own after-party. \nBy 9.00am, Sobers realised he needed to freshen up to be ready for a full day’s play at the home of cricket. \n“I went and had a cold shower, which was cold but I couldn’t feel it,” he laughed, “then I walked up to Lord’s, sat in the dressing room and when I was ready I walked out there.” \nWith a belly still full of grog and a foggy head, Sobers struggled through the first over bowled by lanky England quick Bob Willis. \n“All I could see was all arms and legs,” Sobers said. \n“I’ve always said that people who played forward were survivors, because I used to play on the back foot. \n“I went forward trying to survive and the first five balls I missed, and I could hear some laughter coming from up in the dressing room and said to myself ‘well they know something’. \n“After that, the next ball hit the middle and from then hell broke loose.” Sobers is remembered as one of cricket’s all-time greats.   \nSobers, acclaimed as the most versatile Test cricketer of all time, came to Australia during the summer and sat down to tell the story of his life on Cricket Legends. \nHe details the remarkable story of how he rose to greatness despite being born with six fingers on both hands and how Sir Donald Bradman secretly revealed to him how he felt a famous English bowler was a “chucker”. \nHe tells the full story behind his incredible six sixes in an over in English county cricket — and the bond it formed with the bowler who delivered that over, Malcolm Nash — and reveals why Steve Smith is one of his favourite modern players. \nWATCH Cricket Legends with Sir Garfield Sobers on Friday on Fox Sports More channel 507 after the day’s play on day two of the first Test between Australia and India.
