HAMISH MCNEILLY/FAIRFAX NZ \nOne of seveal security guards at Cadbury factory on the day it was announced it would close. \nWhen Cadbury was taken over by Kraft Foods (now Mondelez) in 2010, the company moved quickly to close a British factory and shifted production to Poland. \n\"So am surprised that it took seven years to close Dunedin.\" HAMISH MCNEILLY/FAIRFAX NZ \nCadbury sponsor the annual Jaffa Race in Dunedin \nThe company could expect a consumer backlash initially, but,\" in the long run, people seem to keep buying the products that they like\". \nHowever that backlash might be stronger in New Zealand given how badly the chocolate maker had operated over the last ten years. \nThe use of palm oil , used as a substitute for cocoa butter, hurt the brand, which dropped the ingredient in 2009 due to public pressure.
