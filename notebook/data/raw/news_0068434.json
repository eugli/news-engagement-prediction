Print \n“What happens to all the leftover food at weddings?” \nThe question stunned Padmanaban Gopalan. Posed by a student, in the middle of Gopalan’s talk on landfills and the havoc they wreak on the environment, the question about food wastage convinced the 24-year-old that he needed to respond with positive action, not words. \nSome years later, in 2014, Gopalan founded the No Food Waste initiative in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Supported by Sudhakar Mohan, N Balaji and a team of 20 full-time volunteers, the No Food Waste initiative redistributes surplus food from large-scale events like weddings to nursing homes, orphanages and slums. Operating across cities such as Coimbatore, Chennai, Salem, Erode, Tadepalligudem and Delhi, the team has re-distributed food to over 2 lakh people since its inception. Their ultimate goal, according to Balaji, is not just to minimise food wastage, but also to make people aware of the larger implications of waste management. \nWhen it comes to making big changes, small steps are everything. “It started off very simply,” Balaji said, recounting the early days of No Food Waste. “Padmanaban just set up a Facebook page and a helpline number to spread the word.” \nAt first, volunteers collected enough food for 20 to 30 people, making multiple bus trips from the venues of various events. As their work gained recognition, they began receiving calls for larger quantities. Soon, more volunteers joined. The Rotary Club of Coimbatore provided them with a van, which helped increase the capacity of food transported. Today, the initiative has five vehicles ferrying food across nine cities. \nWhat does a typical day for the volunteers of No Food Waste look like? First, the dedicated helpline for No Food Waste receives information from wedding parties and other functions about the location and quantity of surplus food. Then, volunteers collect the food (which should be sufficient to feed 50 people or more). Pick-ups and distributions for the day are mapped according to the number of venues volunteers must visit – all food is distributed within an hour of collection. \nTypically, No Food Waste re-distributes food three times a day. During wedding season, days can get much more hectic. If food is collected very late in the day, it can also be stored at No Food Waste’s office, to be re-distributed the next day during their morning route. At every stage, volunteers keep an eye on the quality of food and when it was prepared. After each collection, vessels must be duly cleaned. \nTo ensure contributions do not go to waste, No Food Waste gives donors the choice to either drop off small quantities of food or directly donate them at designated hunger spots. The locations of these hunger spots are mapped on The No Food Waste app – these are usually places where food for 10 or more people is required. \nIn addition to this, Goapalan has also set up food and beverage dispensing refrigerators in Coimbatore and Salem. “These are refrigerators manned by personnel, where people can drop off food,” Balaji said. “The quality is checked to ensure the food is fit for consumption. These Food and Beverage ATMs, as we call them, are capable of storing food for about 40 people.” Empower and educate \n“Nearly 40% of all our food is wasted,” Balaji said. “Even if we salvage half of this and redirect it to where it is needed, it can create a huge impact on the issue of food waste and food shortage.” \nFood surplus and shortage usually exist within a few miles of each other. While the NGO is working on reaching out to more cities, the team feels that in order for any significant changes to occur, people need to realise the magnitude of food loss. \n“We work on increasing awareness through various measures,” Balaji explained. “One is by encouraging anna daan, or food charity, of surplus, untouched food. We also audit food waste at schools and colleges. By involving students in monitoring food waste, we hope to make them more conscious from an early age.” \nIn the future, No Food Waste plans to put some of the wasted food to use by establishing biogas and compost facilities. They are working towards getting the funds for these initiatives. With increasing regional, national and international recognition (No Food Waste was listed as one among the top 10 initiatives in the world which are tackling food waste through mobile apps) the organisation is still plagued with logistical issues – not being able to get to a food source on time because of traffic, for instance. \nWith more volunteer support and Food & Beverage ATM installations, they hope to mitigate some of these obstacles. As Gopalan puts it, “Feed people, not landfills.” We welcome your comments at Some of the worst decisions made in history From the boardroom to the battlefield, bad decisions have been a recipe for disaster Published Feb 20, 2017. Print \nOn New Year’s Day, 1962, Dick Rowe, the official talent scout for Decca Records, went to office, little realising that this was to become one of the most notorious days in music history. He and producer Mike Smith had to audition bands and decide if any were good enough to be signed on to the record label. At 11:00 am, either Rowe or Smith, history is not sure who, listened a group of 4 boys who had driven for over 10 hours through a snowstorm from Liverpool, play 15 songs. After a long day spent listening to other bands, the Rowe-Smith duo signed on a local group that would be more cost effective. The band they rejected went on to become one of the greatest acts in musical history – The Beatles. However, in 1962, they were allegedly dismissed with the statement “Guitar groups are on the way out”.

History is full of examples of poor decisions that have had far reaching and often disastrous consequences. \nIn the world of business, where decisions are usually made after much analysis, bad decisions have wiped out successful giants. Take the example of Kodak – a company that made a devastating wrong decision despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Everyone knows that Kodak couldn’t survive as digital photography replaced film. What is so ironic that Alanis Morissette could have sung about it, is that the digital camera was first invented by an engineer at Kodak as early as 1975. In 1981, an extensive study commissioned by Kodak showed that digital was likely to replace Kodak’s film camera business in about 10 years. Astonishingly, Kodak did not use this time to capitalise on their invention of digital cameras – rather they focused on making their film cameras even better. In 1996, they released a combined camera – the Advantix, which let users preview their shots digitally to decide which ones to print. Quite understandably, no one wanted to spend on printing when they could view, store and share photos digitally. The Advantix failed, but the company’s unwillingness to shift focus to digital technology continued. Kodak went from a 90% market share in US camera sales in 1976 to less than 10% in 2012, when it filed for bankruptcy. It sold off many of its biggest businesses and patents and is now a shell of its former self.

However, Britain remained out of his grasp and so, he imposed a trade blockade against the island nation. But the Russia’s Czar Alexander I refused to comply due to its effect on Russian trade. To teach the Russians a lesson, Napolean assembled his Grand Armée – one of the largest forces to ever march on war. Estimates put it between 450,000 to 680,000 soldiers. Napoleon had been so successful because his army could live off the land i.e. forage and scavenge extensively to survive. This was successful in agriculture-rich and densely populated central Europe. The vast, barren lands of Russia were a different story altogether. The Russian army kept retreating further and further inland burning crops, cities and other resources in their wake to keep these from falling into French hands. A game of cat and mouse ensued with the French losing soldiers to disease, starvation and exhaustion. The first standoff between armies was the bloody Battle of Borodino which resulted in almost 70,000 casualties. Seven days later Napoleon marched into a Moscow that was a mere shell, burned and stripped of any supplies. No Russian delegation came to formally surrender. Faced with no provisions, diminished troops and a Russian force that refused to play by the rules, Napolean began the long retreat, back to France. His miseries hadn’t ended - his troops were attacked by fresh Russian forces and had to deal with the onset of an early winter. According to some, only 22,000 French troops made it back to France after the disastrous campaign.

The stakes were extremely high – Pakistan had never won a major cricket tournament, the atmosphere at the Sharjah stadium was electric, the India-Pakistan rivalry at its height. Pakistan had one wicket in hand, with four runs required off one ball. And then the unthinkable happened – Chetan Sharma decided to bowl a Yorker. This is an extremely difficult ball to bowl, many of the best bowlers shy away from it especially in high pressure situations. A badly timed Yorker can morph into a full toss ball that can be easily played by the batsman. For Sharma who was then just 18 years old, this was an ambitious plan that went wrong. The ball emerged as a low full toss which Miandad smashed for a six, taking Pakistan to victory. Almost 30 years later, this ball is still the first thing Chetan Sharma is asked about when anyone meets him. \nSo, what leads to bad decisions? While these examples show the role of personal biases, inertia, imperfect information and overconfidence, bad advice can also lead to bad decisions. One of the worst things you can do when making an important decision is to make it on instinct or merely on someone’s suggestion, without arming yourself with the right information.
