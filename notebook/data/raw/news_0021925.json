The incident came just hours after a mortar reportedly fell in the Golan Heights in the Levant, near the Syria border fence. The missile did not cause any known causalities or damage. The IDF said that in response, it had struck a target in the northern Syrian Golan. Three of the missiles were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system, according to the Israeli Defence Force's Southern Command Islamic State has waged a deadly insurgency against Egyptian security forces in the Sinai, but attacks on Israel from Egyptian territory are rare. In 2011, assailants who came from the Sinai killed eight Israelis in a triple ambush north of Eilat, after which pursuing Israeli forces killed seven attackers and five Egyptian police. In 2013, four jihadists were killed by an Egyptian air strike as they were about to fire a rocket at Israel, according to the Egyptian military. A total of 11 people were treated for shock in Eilat's Joseftal Hospital following the attack, including an Australian tourist, four holidaymakers and half a dozen local residents In 2014, two Israeli soldiers on patrol were wounded by unidentified men who fired an anti-tank weapon from the Sinai during an attempted drug-smuggling operation, according to the Israeli military. And in 2015, rockets fired from Sinai hit southern Israel without causing any casualties, in an attack that IS claimed responsibility for. The Iron Dome has not intercepted rockets bound for Eilat since 2014, when it stopped missiles during the fighting with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, code-named Operation Protective Edge by the IDF. The system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range missiles fired from distances of 2.5 miles to 43 miles away, whose trajectory would take them to a populated area.
