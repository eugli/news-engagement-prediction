SHARE NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has announced a new approach to the government's beleaguered council mergers policy. Photo: Daniel Munoz \nThe decision was reached in an extraordinary meeting of cabinet, convened for the express purpose of resolving the council mergers issue. \nThe decision is set to inflame anti-merger advocates who have persistently called for a reversal of the policy, including the de-amalgamation of already merged councils. Advertisement \nLast May, 44 councils were sacked and replaced with 19 larger councils, helmed by an administrator until council elections in September 2017. \nTuesday's decision follows more nine months of legal action waged by a string of councils across the state after the policy was announced by the Baird government last May. \nThe newest council, the Bayside Council, was proclaimed in September following the conclusion of legal action by the former Botany Bay council, taking the total number of mergers to seven in the city and 13 in the bush. \nBut the legal action has kept a further 11 merger proposals affecting 29 councils from proceeding, with a new round of legal challenges due to be heard in the NSW Supreme Court of Appeal this month. \nWoollahra Council, which is fighting a merger with Randwick and Waverley councils, is due to have its legal challenge considered by the High Court this month. \nPressure mounted on the Berejiklian government to determine its commitment to the policy after Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro vowed last month to end local government mergers in the bush. \nMr Barilaro's commitment came the day after Mike Baird announced his resignation as premier on January 19, and before the Liberal partyroom had anointed Ms Berejiklian their new leader. \nSince taking up the premiership, Ms Berejiklian signalled she would reconsider the policy, promising to listening to the community and, after chairing her first cabinet meeting, declaring \"I will fix this\" . \nThe option of plebiscites was initially canvassed as a solution to determine whether mergers in the pending council districts should proceed, but Tuesday's decisions shows this path has been abandoned. \nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:02:29.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
