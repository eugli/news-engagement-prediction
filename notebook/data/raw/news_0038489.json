There is no value in ‘debating’ him,” Scahill tweeted. Appearing on Maher’s show will give Yiannopoulos a major platform for “his racist, anti-immigrant campaign,” wrote Scahill, co-founding editor of The Intercept news website.\nSchahill said he respects Maher’s show as an arena for debate and discussion but called Yiannopoulous “many bridges too far.”\nWhy I will not appear this week on Real Time with Bill Maher. pic.twitter.com/SOoE3udrDr\n— jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) February 15, 2017\nHBO confirmed that Scahill had canceled. There was no immediate comment from Maher.\nIn an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Yiannopoulos said that “public shaming and grandstanding don’t work any more. … Thanks for proving my point for me, Jeremy Scahill! You can look forward to pulling out of a lot more shows in the next few decades.”\nYiannopoulos writes for Breitbart News, considered by many a platform for the so-called “alt-right” movement, an offshoot of conservatism that mixes racism, white nationalism and populism.\nHis Twitter account was suspended last year after a series of racially insensitive tweets aimed at “Ghostbusters” actress Leslie Jones, who is black. Yiannopoulos has denied he is a white nationalist or racist.\nIn his email, Yiannopoulos decried what he called examples of “left on right political violence,” including chaotic protests that erupted at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month over his planned speech, which was canceled.\n“But sure, my speech is the real threat,” he said.\nHe has a forthcoming book, “Dangerous,” to be published by a Simon & Schuster imprint geared to conservatives. Slammed by criticism from the Chicago Review of Books and others, Simon & Schuster said it doesn’t condone discrimination and said the book is about free speech.\nYiannopoulos is scheduled as Friday’s opening interview guest for “Real Time.” Others set for the show include round table guests Larry Wilmore and former Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston and, for a mid-show interview, Leah Remini.\n___\nLynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/SOoE3udrDr", "https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/832011012018728960", "http://twitter.com/lynnelber."], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:54:49.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
