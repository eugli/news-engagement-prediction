Despite her apology, Conway, in the 25-minute-long conversation, doubled down on her criticism of the media, standing by a list of 78 events related to global terror that the White House claims went “underreported” by the press. \nTapper spoke in defense of CNN, telling Conway, “Saying that we don’t cover terrorism, that’s just false. It’s offensive.” \n“What the president is saying is … that there are other attacks that don’t get as much coverage,” she said. \nShe stopped short, however, of agreeing with President Donald Trump’s assertion that CNN is “fake news,” as he alleged in his first press conference as president. “Are we fake news, Kellyanne?,” pressed Tapper. “Is CNN fake news?” \n“I don’t think CNN is fake news,” Conway said. “I think there are some reports everywhere, in print, on TV, on radio, in conversation that are not well researched and are sometimes based on falseness.” \nConway has faced backlash due to her comments on the truth in recent weeks. In an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last month, Conway defended White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s claims on the size of Trump’s inauguration crowd by calling them “alternative facts.” As host Chuck Todd corrected her, “Alternative facts are not facts. They’re falsehoods.” \nWatch the full interview above.
