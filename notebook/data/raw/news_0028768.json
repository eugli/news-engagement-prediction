Unsurprisingly, Bey was literally glowing from head-to-toe on the Grammy Awards stage and accessorized her gilded Peter Dundas gown and ornate headpiece with an out-of-this-world complexion and monochromatic smoky eye and lip. \n\"She has super, super golden skin and everyone knows that when a woman is pregnant she has a glow about her,\" the singer's pro makeup artist Sir John exclusively told us about her look for the night. \"Peter Dundas, who just left Roberto Cavalli and is doing his own thing, came to us with the most beautiful gold, beaded gown.

He kept the lip in the same color family by swiping on a matte nude Dose of Colors bullet ($16; doseofcolors.com ). \nVIDEO: 2017 Grammy Awards Red Carpet Arrivals \nAnd what are Beyoncé and Sir John's essentials for when he's getting her ready to slay the Grammys? A good playlist. \"We pray before shows and she loves my ipod so I make playlists,\" he told us. \"I love old school music so I put together a list with Eartha Kitt and other songs from the ‘50s and ‘60s.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:52:14.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
