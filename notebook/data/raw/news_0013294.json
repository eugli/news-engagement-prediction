He remains in hospital, where he spoke to his lawyer. \nHe said the police operation quickly turned violent and he was set upon by four officers. He struggled to make sure he was in the view of CCTV cameras, and asked the officers why they were doing this to him. \nHe said one officer proceeded to pull his trousers down and rape him with a truncheon. \n\"I fell on to my stomach, I had no strength left,\" he said. \nHe was then sprayed with tear gas around the head and in the mouth and hit over the head, he said. Image copyright AFP Image caption As protesters gathered on Monday, riot police stood guard \nTheo was then taken to a police station where he said a \"much friendlier\" police officer saw his condition and sent him to hospital. \nInterior Minister Bruno Le Roux suspended the officers and said the facts of the case must be established with \"no ambiguity\". \nA lawyer for the officer facing the rape charge said any injury inflicted during the operation was accidental and his client had \"never wished at any time to cause any injury to the victim\". \nA police union chief, Yves Lefebvre, told AP the rape charge was lodged \"to calm or to stop a violent outburst\". 'Feeling of humiliation' \nUnrest was reported in the neighbourhood over the weekend and continued on Monday evening. Reports said a dozen cars were set on fire, rubbish bins burned and arson attempts made on two restaurants. Twenty-four arrests were made. \n\"The feeling of humiliation is felt by people,\" Abdallah Benjana, a former deputy mayor who lives in the neighbourhood, told Associated Press news agency. \n\"What are [the police officers] seeking? To provoke a spark? Isn't there enough gunpowder in those neighbourhoods? \n\"Unemployment, insecurity, high rents... no perspectives for future. They do that to a young man, it can only explode.\" \nThe tensions have revived memories of the 2005 riots around the French capital, when Aulnay-sous-Bois was one of the worst-affected areas.
