Subramaniam said his office is not taking the issue lightly and will act against those found to have spread information and internal circulars without authorisation.\n\"I believe such problem do not occur just in my ministry but others as well.\n\"By leaking classified information, these irresponsible people are only causing panic and giving the public a wrong perception of the government. We will not tolerate this,\" he said here on Wednesday.\nLast week, a Health Ministry circular on an increase in nominal dental charges for treatment at government clinics went viral, causing anxiety among the public.\nThe circular said that extractions, which cost RM1 now, would be increased to RM15, while the price of scaling would rise from RM2 to RM55 and fillings would increase from RM2 to RM25.\nThe ministry explained that the viral message on the new rates reflected basic cost of dental treatment for 2017 in Malaysia without subsidies and would not be imposed on patients.\nDr Subramaniam said an internal investigation was being conducted on the issue while the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission was carrying out a separate one.\n\"The culprits will be dealt with with disciplinary action. Previously, we issued last warnings to several staff who leaked information without permission,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:46:06.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
