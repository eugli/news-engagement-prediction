(Source: Ami Patel/Instagram) Much like her bubbly self, Alia Bhatt ’s sartorial choices are preppy, fun and vibrant – and more often than not, her styling is on point. Continuing her fashionable streak, the chirpy actress – who will next be seen with Varun Dhawan in their upcoming film Badrinath ki Dulhania – during an appearance in the capital for a press meet, stepped out in a beautiful peach dress.\nLooking really breezy and fresh, Bhatt opted for monotone layering as she paired her dress with an embroidered peach jacket, both from fashion designer Anita Dongre’s latest collection. Her marsala shade sandals added a nice contrast to her pastel look.\nALSO READ | Shilpa Shetty or Sonakshi Sinha, thigh-high slit gown or a sporty short dress – who worked the monochrome better?\nWe think stylists Ami Patel and Sanjay Kumar Dauhaliya did a good job here.
