On that day of peak demand, we also had 1,000 megawatts of solar generating during the middle of the day. \n\"I'm not expecting any problems in Queensland or south-east Queensland in coming days. I'm very confident the network will perform.\" \nMr Price said because the heatwave would impact Queensland over the weekend, there would be less commercial stress placed on the grid. \n\"It would be unusual for us to hit a peak demand on a Saturday or Sunday,\" he told ABC Radio Brisbane's Craig Zonca . \n\"We monitor the load routinely and we have a well developed emergency response plan and trained crews ready to respond.\" Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \nChris Stolz from Engineers Australia said the eastern states were often better off than South Australia when it came to power generation. \n\"We have a good network up and down the coast where the generating capacity and the demand is linked,\" he said. \nMr Stoltz said load shedding had also been used successfully in the past, when demand was high. \n\"Load shedding is turning off supply to certain industry or consumers,\" Mr Stolz said. \n\"We had a domestic example in South Australia a few years ago when they trialled turning air conditioners off in certain areas on a rotation basis. \n\"When demand was high, your air-con would go on for 10 minutes and then it would go off for someone else's to go on for 10 minutes.\" \nMr Stolz said businesses had even been paid in the past to turn off their power in times of high demand. \n\"That's how we can reduce the loading in times of high demand,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:09:20.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
