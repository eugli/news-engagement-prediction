In the meantime, tourism bungalows have been ordered to serve guests only locally-sourced, organic produce. \nThe Guardian reports that Father Luc Dini, head of Torba’s tourism council, believes a ban on overseas food would benefit the islanders’ health.

Regularly imported foods include rice, sweets, biscuits and tinned food.

We don’t want that to happen here and we don’t want to develop the illnesses that come with a western junk food diet.” The province has a bounty of produce to sustain itself, tourism authorities say Credit: AUSCAPE \nIt has not yet been decided whether alcohol will be included in the ban. \nVanuatu’s central government is supportive of the plan, he said, and would be closely gauging the reaction from locals and tourists. It’s a policy that could well benefit other South Pacific nations, which have some of the highest obesity rates in the world, a fact that some blame on the adoption of Western cuisine and cooking methods. \nThe nine most obese countries or territories in the world – American Samoa, Nauru, the Cook Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Samoa, Palau, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands – are all in the South Pacific.
