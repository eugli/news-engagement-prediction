Click to see content: disrepair_councils_130217 \nCouncils often find themselves paying out more in legal fees than they do in compensation, as local authorities are often told they have to pay the legal costs of both parties should they lose the case. \nFor example, Birmingham City Council paid out £200,000 in compensation to tenants over the last five years but spent an additional £1.5m on legal costs. \nNina Patel, from Jackson Canter Solicitors, rejects the idea that lawyers are cashing in on the problem. \n\"This is not about money and profit, it's about the condition of the properties being rented out by councils,\" she said. \n\"Councils are very quick to charge rents and evict our clients if they fall behind with their payments, so equally why can't these tenants go and get legal advice if the repairs they are asking to be done aren't being carried out?\" Image copyright BBC News Image caption Lawyer Nina Patel says more council tenants are now becoming aware of their rights and how they can claim compensation \nLocal authorities across England have faced sustained cuts to their overall budgets in recent years. \nHowever, the latest local government budget data shows that the amount earmarked for maintaining and repairing council properties has remained relatively stable at about £1.7bn a year. \nCouncillor Martin Tett, LGA housing spokesman, said: \"The number of 'non-decent' council homes has plummeted in the last 20 years from 746,000 in 2006 to 80,000 in 2016. \n\"This is a 90% drop and shows councils are doing a great job in difficult circumstances to ensure homes are at a decent standard.\" \nHe added: \"Councils desperately need the powers and access to funding to improve existing housing stock, replace homes and reinvest in building more of the genuine affordable homes our communities desperately need.\" \nAdditional reporting by Anna Crossley and Nicola Hudson Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:16:02.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
