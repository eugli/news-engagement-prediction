Kate wore red Luisa Spagnoli suit (John Stillwell/PA ) \n\"I realise how central, values like these have been to me throughout my life. \n\"That is why William and I want to teach our little children, George and Charlotte just how important these things are as they grow up. \n\"In my view it is just as important as excelling at maths or sport,\" she said. \nShe told an assembly of London pupils she believes it is important to give young children \"the best possible start in life. \nDrawing on her own upbringing she said, \"\"People often ask me why I am so interested in the mental health of children and young people. \n\"The answer is quite simple - it is because I think that every child should have the best possible start in life. \n\"When I was growing up I was very lucky. My family was the most important thing to me. \n\"They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age. \n\"For some children, maybe there are some here today; I know that life can sometimes feel difficult and full of challenges,\" said. \n\"I think that every child should have people around them to show them love, and to show them kindness, and nurture them as they grow. This is what Place2Be is doing so amazingly here in your school,\" she said. \nThe 35-year-old was joined by her husband Prince William as she visited Mitchell Brook Primary School in Neasden, north London, in her role as patron of the children's charity Place2Be. \nThe royals looked in upbeat as they greeted flag-waving children and staff before making their way inside for 'The Big Assembly', an event being held at schools across the country to mark Children's Mental Health Week. \nKate went on, \"It is great to be here to support Children's Mental Health week. \n\"Recently I met an 11-year-old girl who was helped by Place2Be. She told me that if you keep your feelings inside, you can feel as though you will blow up like a balloon. \n\"But, by talking to someone about them, it can make you feel so much better. \n\"I thought that was such a clever way of looking at it. \nKate said talking about problems with somebody close is the best way to resolve them. \nShe said, \"Whether that is your mother or father, a teacher or a friend. \n\"know that in your school you have been working on a project to spread a little kindness and I think this is such an important thing to do. \n\"If you see someone who you think might need help, try and be kind to them. \n\"Keep a look out for them if they are on their own or seem sad or worried. \n\"Perhaps they just need a hug or someone to talk to. \n\"I know it is hard if you are feeling down yourself. \n\"But helping someone out will also make you feel so much better too,\" she said. \nThe visit came at the start of Children’s Mental Health Week as Place2Bs - which Kate has been patron of since 2013 - released a new survey about the concerns of young school pupils. \nThe survey said before they reach the end of primary school, 68 per cent of children in London say they worry “all the time” about at least one thing to do with their school life, home life or themselves \nAmong the top concerns of London pupils are their family (61 per cent), friends being okay (50 per cent), and not doing well at school (49 per cent).
