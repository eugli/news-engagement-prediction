Nearly every day, a new woman claims Trump managed the impossible feat of groping her like an “octopus” in a public place—like a New York night club while she was sitting with friends, or on an airplane where she was surrounded by stewardesses and passengers. \nYou are too smart to give more credence to such gossip than the incriminating facts against Hillary. Over Donald’s many decades in the public eye as a businessman and TV host, none of these women or any eyewitness came forward. No one bothered to make a peep until WikiLeaks exposed 30,322 of Hillary’s emails pocked with damning evidence of her corruption. \nToday, I’ll shine light on facts deserving of your attention. I encourage you to share this information with your neighbor who has a huge Hillary sign in her front lawn—or your “diehard Republican” brother who insists he “can’t in conscience vote for Trump.” Read on. \nShe “Hates” You, He “Loves” You \n“I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it [say she likes everyday Americans] once the first time she says I'm running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion.” –Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta emailed senior policy advisor Jake Sullivan on April 19, 2015. View Cartoon \n“We will make America great again! God bless you and good night. I love you!” –Trump told millions of Americans watching his Republican National Convention speech this summer. \nBeyond his words, Trump’s political action plans prove he cares about protecting the jobs of everyday Americans while also keeping the cost of living down for the poor. His pick for Vice President, Gov. Mike Pence, has proudly declared: “Donald Trump digs coal!” and Trump himself says he plans to “bring back coal.” \nHillary, in contrast, mistakenly conceded that she plans to use you and me as stepping stones to power, saying: “We’re going to raise taxes on the middle class” and “We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business!” \nClinton Kicks Chicks Curbside, Trump Promotes Women \nKathy Shelton was unknown to most Americans until Donald Trump had the courage to give her an opportunity to tell her story of victimization by Hillary Clinton. \nWhen Shelton was 12 years old, she was raped by a 41-year-old man named Thomas Alfred Taylor. Despite DNA evidence proving Taylor’s guilt, Clinton chose to make money and “ do a favor ” for a fellow prosecutor by defending Taylor and ultimately getting him off with less than a year in prison on a technicality. \nDespite admitting to “evidence” of her client’s guilt such as his “ underwear, which was bloody ,” Clinton led the court to believe Shelton provoked Taylor, implying—without proof—that the young girl would “romanticize sexual experiences.” No 12-year-old girl solicits a grown man to assault her to the point of needing a surgical procedure and permanently losing the capacity to bear children. Even if a little girl loses her wits and literally asks a 41-year-old to rape her, he would still commit a crime by doing so. \nChuckling is Clinton’s go-to tactic to dismiss her challengers as fools. Today, she chuckles away claims of her irresponsibly in Benghazi and of jeopardizing our national security by sending and receiving classified documents over an insecure connection. So too, in 1975, she employed ridiculing laughter to make a court of law question Shelton’s story. \nShelton isn’t the only woman Trump has helped. He was one of the first and most vocal advocates for the late Sarah Root and Kate Steinle—young women who died senseless deaths due to loose U.S. immigration and visitation policies that President Obama and Hillary Clinton embrace. \nSniffing out a creeper is an innate, survival skill in every woman’s biology. If a girl’s father, uncle, grandfather, or neighbor ogles women, she’ll sense it before her brothers or male acquaintances. She will feel unsafe and uncomfortable around him—by reflex. She would never spend the time Ivanka Trump spends working alongside her father—in real estate and in his political campaign—of her volition. \nHave you noticed how Chelsea Clinton is not nearly as vocal in defending her father as Ivanka Trump is of her father? Start noticing Chelsea’s silence. \n“Look, I’m not in every interaction my father has, but he’s not a groper,” Ivanka told CBS this year. “It’s not who he is. And I’ve known my father obviously my whole life, and he has total respect for women. He was promoting women in development and construction at a time when it was unheard of. There was no trend towards equality in the real estate and construction industry in the 1980s, and he was doing it because he believes, ultimately, in merit.” \nBefore you dismiss Ivanka as naïve, know that even Hillary Clinton considers Ivanka credible. In the latest presidential debate, Clinton volunteered this nugget of praise for Trump: “I respect his children.” \nHillary is Ill, Trump Pumps Iron \n“Have you talked with her at all about taxes and health? I'm know both are hyper sensitive but I wonder if both are better dealt with very early so we control them—early rather than responding to calls for transparency.” -Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook via email to Podesta in 2014 \nHillary doesn’t have Donald’s energy or fitness. She’s on record for tumbling on her way to a White House meeting ; struggling up stairs in 2011 and in 2016 in ways even Snopes failed to dismiss; losing her balance last month at a 9/11 memorial, crumpling into her motorcade , and erupting into frequent coughing spells. \nEnergy! There’s no use denying Trump has copious energy. Strength and vigor resound in his voice; his posture; and in the grueling schedule he maintains with a thumbs up and a smile. Research also shows high-energy people are happier and more fulfilled than low-energy individuals. There’s much to be said for electing a president who comes to work everyday with enthusiasm. \nHillary’s lack of excitement for serving America as president is evident in her robotic body language, stiff smiles and scripted sentences. Even Millennial women chose Bernie Sanders by a margin of 37 points over the first woman running for the world’s highest public office! Her mission for political power is obvious while Trump—a D.C. outsider—conveys genuine passion for improving our national security and economy. \n“You’d Be in Jail.” \n“You’d be in jail,” was Donald Trump’s mic drop moment during the latest presidential debate as he detailed factual evidence warranting a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary’s negligence and abuse of power as Secretary of State. \nHillary’s husband Bill dodged the draft. He proceeded to dodge prison after scientific evidence proved he sexually abused his young female intern Monica Lewinsky—and then lied about doing so under oath. Hillary began her law career by saving a thug from a life behind bars after scientific evidence showed he raped a 12-year-old girl. Later, as First Lady, she lowered herself to slandering women her husband exploited with pejoratives like “bimbo” “looney toon” and “trash.” \nYou deserve better. Don’t sit out Election Day with a false sense of “voting your conscience.” No well-formed conscience would condone the enablement of Hillary Clinton’s life-long career of corruption at the expense of taxpayers. Do the right thing for yourself and your progeny and vote Trump-Pence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:21:14.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
