Image: mashable composite/getty By Johnny Lieu 2017-02-23 06:26:09 UTC \nIn a significant setback, the Trump administration rescinded federal guidelines that give transgender students the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity. \nAccording to the Washington Post , officials from the Department of Justice and the Department of Education told the U.S. Supreme Court to \"disregard memos\" on transgender student rights. SEE ALSO: This photo series proves trans people are more than their gender identity \nThe guidelines, first issued by the Obama administration, say that prohibiting transgender students from using facilities which match their gender violates federal anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sex. \nThese have been withdrawn because officials say the term \"sex\" is open to legal interpretation. The letter to be sent to public schools gives the example of Texas, where a federal district court stated the term \"sex\" refers \"unambiguously to biological sex.\" \nIn a statement, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said it was \"an issue best solved at the state and local level.\" \nGavin Grimm is a transgender student fighting to use the boy's restroom at school. \nImage: Steve Helber/AP/REX/Shutterstock \nIt's curious timing, considering the highly publicised case of trans student Gavin Grimm , who is set to have his case heard all the way at U.S. Supreme Court in March. \nGrimm is taking on the Gloucester County school board to use the boy's bathroom at his high school, after it rescinded the right for him to do so. His case recently came under the spotlight after actress Laverne Cox gave it attention at the Grammys. \nThe latest setback prompted people to step up and protect trans youth. We need to protect trans youth and stand up against this cruelty that hurts our kids.

What jobs does that create? How is that keeping the US safe? #Resist \n— billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 23, 2017 To young trans folk: Remember this is your school too. You deserve equal access, affirmation & education. You belong. Nothing is wrong w you \n— Janet Mock (@janetmock) February 23, 2017 Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay. \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 Who should stand with the marginalized, the mocked, the bullied, the confused, the outcast, the minority? The Christian should. #trans \n— James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) February 23, 2017 Trans kids drop out of school & commit suicide b/c of bullying. Now we can add the Secretary of Education and President 2 list of bullies.
