Getty Images Getty Images 9 Michael McDowell \nFor the first time in his nine-year NASCAR career, Michael McDowell is slated to complete the full 36-race schedule. That alone will boost his performance in 2017. After finishing 30 th in the points standings last season, expect McDowell to be in the mid-20s this season. \nMcDowell finished in the top 10 twice in 2016 and closed out the season with four top-20 finishes in the final seven races. Don’t be surprised to see McDowell pulling out some solid top-20 finishes in 2017. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 8 Ty Dillon \nThe Rookie of the Year battle seems to be heavily focused on Toyota drivers, Erik Jones and Daniel Suarez, but Dillon sent out a call in Daytona 500 qualifying that his No. 13 Germain Racing Chevrolet will be a contender in that battle, too. \nIn 2016, Casey Mears finished 28 th in the points standings in the No. 13. Dillon should be able to outperform that mark in 2017 and finish near 20 th in the points standings. Mark J. Rebilas Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports 7 David Ragan \nMaking the flip from BK Racing back to Front Row Motorsports should be a solid boost in performance for Ragan in 2017. He finished 33 rd in the standings with BK Racing and posted a best finish of 16 th in the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona. \nRagan had success at the superspeedways in his first go-round with Front Row and should be more competitive in general this season. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 6 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. \nThis is a defining year for Stenhouse and Roush Fenway Racing. The team has downsized to a two-car operation and Stenhouse and Trevor Bayne are now the faces of the organization. \nStenhouse had his fair share of ups and downs in 2016 with a career-high in top-five and top-10 finishes, but the results were only good enough for 21 st in the standings. Expect Stenhouse to compete for his first Cup Series win and make the playoffs for the first time in his career. 5 Danica Patrick \nThe 2017 season has already been a huge leap forward for Danica Patrick as she posted her career-best finish in the Advance Auto Parts Clash. Yes, it was only a 17-car field that she finished fourth in, but she avoided trouble and brought home a solid result. That's all you can ask for. \nThis might not be a huge leap forward that catapults her into the playoffs, but expect Patrick to be more competitive on a weekly basis in 2017 and exceed her 24 th -place finish in the standings and 11 th -place best finish in 2016. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Daniel Suarez \nHe’s stepping into a championship-caliber ride with a ton of quality teammates around him, so high expectations shouldn’t be too much for the 2016 XFINITY Series champion. The current take seems to be that Suarez will have considerable struggles in the season and probably won’t be a playoff driver. \nSuarez has shown he’s a sponge for knowledge in his young career and willing to ask anyone who will answer for help. That’s exactly what you need to learn fast in this sport. Expect Suarez to contend for some wins and be on the bubble of the playoffs. , LAT Images www.latimages.co.uk Nigel Kinrade 3 Kasey Kahne \nBold prediction: Kasey Kahne will lead a lap in 2017. \nAlong with leading a lap, Kahne will grab a win and make the playoffs for the first time since 2014. The fact is if he doesn’t, there will be a ton of pressure for Hendrick to hand over his ride to one of the young guns, like William Byron, sooner rather than later. \nAfter two disappointing seasons, Kahne needs to make the playoffs and advance beyond the opening round to show strides in the right direction. 2 Dale Earnhardt Jr. \nWhat are the expectations for Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2017? There are quite a few different ways to look at that. Staying healthy and completing the full season is step one, getting back to consistently running in the top 10 is the next. \nDale Jr. seems more focused than ever and ready to race this season. We can’t predict his health but if he stays healthy, it shouldn’t take too long for him to get back to top form and contend deep into the playoffs this season. © Logan Whitton Photography / NKP Logan Whitton 1 Clint Bowyer \nBowyer takes the top spot on this list because he’s going to blow away his 2016 performance. His equipment went from backmarker to championship caliber overnight with the move to Stewart-Haas Racing. He enters a ride that Tony Stewart took to a 15 th -place finish in the standings. \nBowyer has the talent and desire to win several races in 2017 and put together a considerable playoff run. This is arguably the best equipment he’s driven in his career. Expect a year for Bowyer that will be similar to Martin Truex Jr.'s performance last season.
