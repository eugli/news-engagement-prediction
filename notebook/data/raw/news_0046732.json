If you can't beat him, join him,\" Lindsay Lohan said in a statement during a Facebook live interview. \nLindsay Lohan, who had a talk with the Turkish President recently, said: \"Turkey really is doing a lot, and that's why I want to try and get the word out to Donald Trump to bring him over there, and have him see all the positive things that they're doing and how America can help as well.\" \n\"And I think it would be a positive thing for America to show their care and support, and for him to experience what it's like for these people and experience how giving Turkey has been to the refugees.\" \nFurther, Lindsay Lohan also added that she would like to stand with the US President Donald Trump and requested people to do the same. \n\"I wish him all the best.
