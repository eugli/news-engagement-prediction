The suburban Maryland location is only 60 miles from Frederick, where the brothers grew up. Bryan has five restaurants in the area; Michael has three in Los Angeles. There’s a natural rivalry between the pair, as anyone who watched them compete on Top Chef: Las Vegas knows (Michael won; Bryan was runner-up). They still talk over and correct each other. But as they’ve matured—Bryan is now 40, and Michael is 38—they’ve realized they have complementary skills (Bryan, the quieter of the two, is a big-picture thinker and multitasker; Michael is all about the details) and that together, they’re an unstoppable force in the kitchen. “Plus, we love each other,” says Michael. “Most of the time.” \nThe dishes they created are idealized versions of the steakhouse classics they loved as kids. Sure, there are mashed potatoes, but they’re exceedingly rich, with what Michael calls the perfect ratio of butter to potatoes: 40/60. Instead of croutons, the Caesar salad is studded with anchovy-Parmesan hush puppies, little umami bombs that nod to the region’s culinary traditions. Shrimp cocktail comes with pickled daikon and Old Bay–seasoned crab crackers inspired by their favorite potato chip flavor from nearby icon Utz. \nBryan and Michael Voltaggio's Recipes:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:34:41.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
