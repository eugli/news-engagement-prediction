Central Coast Without a contract on the table, Monty is considering his options Patrick Boddan & Emma Herd, 22, 2017 3:31pm\nHE’S the inspirational captain of the league’s littlest club, with more assists, chances created and crosses attempted­ than any other player in yellow and navy.\nAnd he could be on the way out.\nNick Montgomery is one of a number of important Mariners players coming off contract at season’s end, but like so many of his teammates his future is up in the air.\nIt could come down to the availability of funds under the new TV rights deal, which remains unconfirmed across the A-League, but waiting could come at the detriment of the club.\n“I spoke to the club a while back and I’m still waiting on an answer,” Montgomery told the Express Advocate . “Obviously it’s coming to that time when I will have to start looking at my other options both here and in Asia and even England is a possibility.\nmedia_camera Montgomery hopes to be able to stay on the Coast beyond this campaign.\n“I don’t miss many games or training sessions and I think my performances this season, along with my fitness levels, have never been in question to warrant playing on for another season at least.\n“I’ve got a wife and two kids who have just started school, they’re the priority for me. Moving around is not something I do too often.\n“My first priority is to stay but, if I have to move, there are some interested parties both here and in Asia.”\nThe 35-year-old realises his performances on the park could dictate where he plays next season, and his focus for now is the team’s week-to-week improvement.\nDespite the 3-0 loss to the Victory, a game in which Montgomery didn’t feature, it’s the sort of attitude that has the Mariners on the cusp of a finals­ berth.\n“With seven games to go there are a lot of points to play for,” he said.\nmedia_camera The Mariners are currently ninth on the table, but can jump to seventh with a win in Newcastle. Picture: Mark Scott\n“All of a sudden we’re nipping at the heels of those teams just above us and we’re more than capable of going on a run. I think we’ve shown that, when we are on form and play as a team, that we can beat anyone in this league.”\nThe Englishman sees Sunday’s F3 derby as an opportunity for himself and his uncontracted teammates to put their best foot forward on one of the toughest stages of all.\n“It’s been disappointing, to be honest, the last couple of seasons where these matches probably haven’t had as much meaning as they did in the past,” Montgomery said.\n“Everything is set up for this to be a massive game and whoever can get a result is going to take a step closer to the top six.\n“There are a lot of teams fighting for those spots.”", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/87d07358a89cde22ad6f8ba691bc6cd3?width=650", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Monty%20weighing%20up%20Coast%20future&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Fb3c04676f767ac12ed2e26beb3209653", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/central-coast/sport", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Fb3c04676f767ac12ed2e26beb3209653&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Fb3c04676f767ac12ed2e26beb3209653", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b324a27b9c5c3db48c143b4e69bbcbbc?width=1024", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fcentral-coast%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Fb3c04676f767ac12ed2e26beb3209653", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1cfdce8990d1022c2ff0f37fa2f185ac?width=650", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-21T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:15:21.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
