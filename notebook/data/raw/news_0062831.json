In Fire at Sea , documentarian Gianfranco Rosi shows what life looks like for the island's residents and the rescue crews, cutting between scenes of life on the island and the people who help receive and treat migrants. The film is a deeply humane exploration of the human cost of the crisis and how people live in the midst of it. Availability: In theaters 12) Ennemis Intérieurs (Enemies Within) ShortsHD Nominated for: Live-Action Short The normally despair-laden live-action short film category is downright jolly this year, but for this somber look at how the French government turns the screws on an Algerian Muslim applying for citizenship, so that he’ll give up the names of others who attended a men’s group affiliated with a mosque he attended. (The government suspects them of being terrorists, but provides no evidence.) The short feels almost unbearably timely — making it all the more interesting that it’s set in 1996. Availability: In theaters or via digital download along with other Oscar-nominated short films, as part of the Oscar Shorts program My Life As a Zucchini GKIDS Nominated for: Animated Feature This Swiss animated film (dubbed in English with a terrific cast led by Nick Offerman) essentially asks, \"What if the Peanuts gang lived in a group home for troubled children?\" Young Zucchini finds himself a ward of the state after his mother dies, and his darkly whimsical adventures with the other kids in foster care somehow perfectly walk the line between taking Zucchini’s journey seriously and becoming too depressing to bear. Availability: In some theaters ShortsHD Nominated for: Animated Short This 35-minute, Kickstarter-backed autobiographical short film from Canadian graphic artist Robert Valley portrays his 25-year friendship with a self-destructive but charismatic figure known as Techno. It uses bold, graphic Photoshop-designed animation to follow the narrator and Techno’s difficult relationship, both in terms of the events that transpire and the feelings that are evoked. Given that Pear Cider and Cigarettes began life as a graphic novel, it’s understandable that the film frequently has the feel of a living comic book, but Valley’s use of simple but dynamic animation, music, and narration turn it into something unique, occasionally difficult, and, most of all, memorable. Availability: In theaters or available via digital download along with other Oscar-nominated short films, as part of the Oscar Shorts program 15) The White Helmets Nominated for: Documentary Short The Syria Civil Defense is a group of ordinary men — former builders, tailors, and artisans — who work to extract victims from beneath the rubble in places like Aleppo. The group has saved more than 58,000 people since 2013. This 41-minute documentary short follows the men as they struggle to preventthe loss of life, and lets them tell us why, as one man puts it, \"this job is sacred.\" Availability: Streaming on Netflix; also in theaters or available via digital download along with other Oscar-nominated short films, as part of the Oscar Shorts program Paramount Nominated for: Cinematography Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese deserved better than a mere one nomination for his long-gestating examination of the gap between faith and understanding. Based on the novel of the same name by Shûsaku Endô, the film follows two priests searching for their mentor in 17th-century Japan and trying to provide sustenance to Christians practicing their forbidden faith in hiding. A small, slow, challenging film, Silence is the kind of movie only Scorsese could make, and it’s too bad how thoroughly the Oscars overlooked it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:59:29.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
