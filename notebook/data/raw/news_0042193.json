By: PTI | New Delhi  35 am “After Sultan, someone asked me to put a photograph and I got 1600 likes within minutes.” \nHis career got a face-lift after starring alongside Salman Khan in last year’s blockbuster Sultan and Amit Sadh says he was amused to see how the film also gave a major boost to his social media profile. The actor says he would get very few likes on his photos which he would share online but post the wrestling-based drama he saw a major increase in his followers on Facebook and Instagram. \n“Sultan was a huge film with Salman. I had a great part. I got so much love and attention. My Facebook followers have increased. I was never the digital guy, I used to feel ‘why should I post pictures when I only manage to get 20 likes where as some actor who has done lesser work than me gets 1000 likes’. \n“After Sultan, someone asked me to put a photograph and I got 1600 likes within minutes. Now I try to be active on social media,” Amit told PTI during a recent visit here. The actor’s latest film Running Shaadi released this Friday. \nAlso Read: The bold and the beautiful: How Bollywood’s feisty action heroines held their own \nMeanwhile, Amit Sadh’s Running Shaadi released this weekend.

I am lucky that I am getting great parts. These are great times. I am very grateful to everyone who has helped me to reach here. This is just the start.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:30:17.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
