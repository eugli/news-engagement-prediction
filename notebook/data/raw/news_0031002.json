Well suited for the post: Sam Pointon is dressed accordingly for his new position as the National Rail Museum's Director Of Fun \nIn fact, the museum's bosses were so touched that they decided to offer Sam an honorary position as their Director of Fun. \nHe is now responsible for coming up with ideas to make the York museum more exciting for children. \nAnd he has already suggested one to outgoing director Andrew Scott - a model train play area for children. \nSam, who has two older sisters - Molly, 12, and Grace, nine - also earned himself and his family a behind-the-scenes VIP tour of the museum which covers 400 years of railway history and houses more than 100 locomotives. Heartwarming: The first page of Sam's letter to the museum \nSam said: 'I was very excited when I found out I had got the job because I really like trains and I've been to the museum three times now. I really like the way trains move. \n'My favourite is the Eurostar, which we went on when we were going to France. It was my favourite because it was really fast.' \nSam's father Robin Pointon, 46, said: 'We are all really proud of him. He has always been a huge fan of trains so obviously the National Railway Museum has always been his number one choice.' \nAs part of the reward for Sam's enthusiasm, his family, who live in Leicester's West End, were also treated to tickets to see the York Theatre Royal's hit production of The Railway Children. \nMr Scott said: 'Sam's letter of application was a real delight to read. It's always fantastic to see such young children with a real passion for trains.' Sam's letter in full: I am writing to apply to be the new director of the National Railway Museum. I am only six but I think I can do this job. I have an electricity train track. I can control two trains at once. I have been on lots of trains including Eurostar and some trains in France. I have visited the museum before. I loved watching the trains go round on the turntable. On the other side is a picture of me. Hopefully I can come and meet you for an interview.
