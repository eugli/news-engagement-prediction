Photo: Supplied \nDr Abu Mohamed is featured in photos shaking hands with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and with inter-faith advocate and Gosford Anglican minister Rod Bowers. \nThe video follows an article published in the April edition of Islamic State's Dabiq magazine that listed 21 \"imams of kufr\" that should be killed, including Australian doctor and charity worker Tawfique Chowdhury . \nPrevious criticisms of Sheikh Shady and the Grand Mufti have been parrotted by a small band of extremists in Australia. \nEarlier this month, a court heard a recording from a 16-year-old boy arrested in Bankstown last year, who called the pair \"apostate dogs\" . \nThe boy and his 16-year-old friend had bought two bayonet knives and were allegedly moments away from carrying out an Islamic State-inspired attack. \nA petition was circulated among Australian hardliners in 2014 after Sheikh Abdo's appointment to the police force, asking the Grand Mufti for a fatwa on Muslims joining the police, army or working with the government. It garnered less than 100 signatures. \nIn the latest video, Mufti Ismail Menk, a Zimbabwean cleric with a Facebook following of 2.2 million, is depicted reiterating a widely accepted Islamic teaching that people should obey the law of the land. \n\"As time passes, people need to be taught to uphold the law of the land that they live in as Muslims,\" he says. \"So if you're living in Australia or in the UK or ... in USA, it's important that you respect the law of the land.\" \nSheikh Shady and the Grand Mufti did not respond to requests for comment. \nSheikh Abdo referred Fairfax Media to the NSW Police, who declined to comment on safety arrangements for its chaplain and other religious leaders. \n\"NSW Police Force is aware of the video. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage,\" a spokesman said. \nLast year, Sheikh Shady attracted criticism for anti-gay comments that emerged after the Orlando nightclub massacre. \nHe responded by saying he totally rejected violence and a comment he made about homosexuality being \"a sin\" was a basic religious position shared by other faiths, including Christianity and Judaism. \nRoving imam Keysar Trad said Muslim leaders in Australia had an increasingly tough job. \n\"One side calls you an extremist, one side calls you a sell out,\" he said. \nHe said Sheikh Shady has done \"tremendous work\" helping young people turn away from drugs and crime and he would not be fazed by the video. \n\"He doesn't suit the ISIS agenda,\" he said. \"Most of us want to keep Australia safe while ISIS wants to create a very polarised world. They want to tell Muslims they'll never be accepted in Australian society and, unfortunately, the right-wing elements want to tell us the same.\" \nSeveral community groups and individuals, including Sheikh Shady, have declined to take government grants in the past to avoid creating mistrust or suspicion among their young clients that they will be reported to authorities.
