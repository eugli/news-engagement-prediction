By Mary Papenfuss \nJust when you thought the situation couldn’t get much worse for the Great Barrier Reef comes news that devastating coral bleaching will almost certainly increase significantly — again — in the coming months. \nRecord bleaching hit the 1,400-mile-long reef system in 2016, for the third year in a row, killing more than 65 percent of the coral of the northern reef last year. Climate change is the culprit as the colorful zooxanthellae are expelled from the coral during times of stress. \nCoral can rebound in good times — though it takes as long as a decade — but that’s not likely to happen soon, if ever. The reef is already warmer than it was at this time last year and there’s a strong strong possibility that March and April will set yet another heat record— and a new record for coral bleaching. Workers for the Great Barrier Park Marine Park Authority are already seeing significant bleaching this season.

Officials are receiving “increasing reports of coral bleaching and disease from many parts” of the reef, including some spots already far south of the worst sections of bleaching in 2016 . \nA study last year predicts that significant bleaching will continue at least until 2040 . Lead researcher Gareth Williams of Britain’s Bangor University calls the projections “terrifying.” \n“It’s alarming that the reef is bleaching so soon again, giving no time for recovery from the huge losses of corals in the northern third of the Reef in 2016,” Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
