Gerrymandering.” \nNot taking this one lying down, the band swiftly responded, slamming Schwarzenegger where it hurts most — his role as Mr. Freeze in the 1993 tanker Batman & Robin. . @Schwarzenegger big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator. \n— Nickelback (@Nickelback) February 14, 2017 \nThey tweeted, “big fans. Approval rate this: Batman & Robin. Please leave us out of your future wisdom drops. Danke Shön Herr Governator.” \nThe two cleaned it up in the end, though, with Schwarzenegger acknowledging the swipe and, possibly forgetting Nickelback is very much Canadian, tweeting, “That’s… ice cold. I hope we can agree that we need a freeze on gerrymandering, guys.
