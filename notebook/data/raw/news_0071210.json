Pragya comes out. Just then, a bat enters Abhi’s room. They scream out of fear and jump over the bed. The bat comes near them. Abhi covers Pragya and himself with the bed cover. Abhi asks Pragya to open the window and send the bat out of the room. Pragya dares Abhi to do that. But, they are so scared that they keep lying on the bed under the sheet. Abhi asks Pragya to stay there till morning as it doesn’t look like that the bat will leave the place. Pragya says she cannot as Sarla worries a lot when she stays here in the night. Tanu is looking for Abhi everywhere as she has plans to take him out and celebrate the Valentine’s Day. She enters Abhi’s room and sees Abhi and Pragya lying on the bed with their bodies covered under a single sheet. She takes it in a wrong way and shouts at Abhi. She cries and says how can Abhi do this with her, how can he romance with Pragya on Valentine’s Day. More from the world of Entertainment: \n\nAalia sees Purab smiling and thinking something.
