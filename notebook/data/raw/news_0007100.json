But only 1% are submitted to the minister of internal affairs for individual consideration in the way Thiel's was. Documents show #CitizenThiel never lived in NZ, had no intention of living in NZ, and had a cosy citizenship ceremony in the US. #nzpol â€” Iain Lees-Galloway (@IainLG) February 1, 2017 \nLabour Party lawmaker Ian Lees-Galloway said the decision to make Thiel a citizen was \"entirely about money.\" \n\"In this turbulent and insecure world New Zealand citizenship has become an asset ... our citizenship should not be for sale,\" he tweeted. \nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs said in response: \"This is New Zealand -- we do not sell our citizenship; it is earned.\" \nThe relatively small nation is very competitive in international quality of life comparisons. It has high quality healthcare and education, low crime rates and spectacular nature. Well if Thiel never had any intention of living here there was no reason to grant him citizenship. pic.twitter.com/YYWrPrFDw4 \nRelated: Tech companies criticize travel ban but not their investor Peter Thiel \nThiel was born in Germany, but moved to the U.S. as a child with his family. He also holds U.S. citizenship. \nThiel's political views are best described as libertarian. He has invested money in projects aimed at making people immortal, developing floating cities away from the reach of governments and convincing young people not to go to college. \nRepresentatives for Thiel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n-- Jethro Mullen contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:19:59.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
