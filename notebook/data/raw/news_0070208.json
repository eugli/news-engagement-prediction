Related Articles January 26, 2017 $50 million in budget woes hit two of Colorado’s largest school districts \nThe bipartisan bills could change that, increasing access to computer science courses for the state’s black, Latino and rural students, and — for the first time — begin to define what a quality STEM program is. \nThe first bill scheduled to be debated by the House Education Committee on Monday would require schools to include technology in lessons alongside traditional subjects, such as English and civics. \nIt would also require the education department to create lessons to help educators teach computer science as a standalone course, and set up a $500,000 grant program to help train them. \n“Kids need to be up to speed on these things in order to function in the current marketplace,” said Senate President Kevin Grantham, a Canon City Republican and one of the bill’s sponsors, along with Speaker Crisanta Duran, a Denver Democrat. “The more they’re attuned to the technology of the times — all the better.
