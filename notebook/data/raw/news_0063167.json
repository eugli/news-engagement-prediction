Accordingly, Moody's has revised its real GDP growth forecast to 2.4 per cent in 2017 and 2.5 per cent in 2018, from 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. \n\nMoody's forecast assumes the US Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate by 75-100 basis points in three to four rate hikes in 2017. \"We expect the Fed to err on the side of caution and tolerate somewhat above-target inflation in the near term.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:54:01.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
