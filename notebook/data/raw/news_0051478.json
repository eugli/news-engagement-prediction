IndiaToday.in | Written by Srivatsan A + A - Jyothika \nAfter a five-year-long hiatus, Jyothika made a stunning comeback with 36 Vayathinile (2015), a remake of Malayalam hit How Old Are You. The film was highly successful at the box office and fetched Jyothika the Filmfare Award for Best Actress- Tamil. \nJyothika, who is teaming up with the National Award winning filmmaker Bramma for Magalir Mattum, has signed her next with filmmaker Bala. \nBe it Pithamagan or Naan Kadavul, Bala is one of the daring filmmakers of Tamil cinema we have today. Known for his rustic characters, it isn't clear if Bala would return to his forte with Jyothika. \nEarlier to this, reports suggested that the actor has been paired opposite Ilayathalapathy Vijay for his next with director Atlee. However, the Kushi actor opted out of the project due to reasons unknown. \nIf things materialise, Bala's film is expected to release in the second half of this year. \nMeanwhile, Magalir Mattum is a women-centric film that stars Bhanupriya, Saranya Ponvannan and Urvashi in important roles. The teaser of the film was release recently and received great response from the Tamil people. With Gibran's music, the film is expected to release in summer.
