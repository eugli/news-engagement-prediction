He was believed to be having financial problems that led to him being unable to pay rent, telling friends he had lost money in what was a “long story”. \nIn a Facebook post published in August Mr Southern said he had had a “very very bad year so far”, and was moving and “starting over again”. \nHe had been seeking casual work and selling off his belongings. \nSince the incident, the man’s social media profile has become a log of hateful messages with friends and strangers posting messages wishing the man would “die in prison” and “burn in hell”. Shaun Southern indicated he had been struggling financially. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook The Leeman caravan site where Shaun Southern lived. Mr Southern said in August he needed to sell his caravans and “try to make as much money back on them as possible”. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nOther commenters intervened suggesting Mr Southern be left alone “for his children’s sake”. \nOn the day of the crash Mr Southern was seen fishing on Wonnerup beach, north of Busselton. \nOne woman who claimed to have seen him earlier in the day said his behaviour was concerning and that she had called the police, while another account suggested he did not appear agitated. \nMr Southern had not been wearing a seatbelt when he was seen driving completely erratically on Saturday ahead of the 4.45pm crash. \nA witness who was first at the scene of the fatal crash said he had been following the car for around 10 minutes because he was worried an innocent person would be hurt. \nDylan Mateljan began filming the Landcruiser after calling police capturing terrifying vision of the car taking out street signs and forcing other vehicles off the road. \nWitnesses said it appeared the driver looked like he was “trying to hit someone”. \nMs Pratt was unable to escape the path of the vehicle before it smashed into her Rav4 and exploded in a fireball. Jenni Pratt died in the crash near Capel in WA.
