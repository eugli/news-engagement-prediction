The cat, named Albus, had been shot with a pellet gun and subsequently died from his injuries.\nAlbus was taken to the vet by his owner and an X-ray revealed that a pellet had caused significant internal injuries and bleeding. Sadly the cat died from his injuries. “I am appealing for anyone who has information about this incident, believes they know who is responsible or heard any noises, that could have been a pellet gun firing, in the area around the time stated to contact me via the Hertfordshire Constabulary non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference B2/17/615.”\n– PC Kelly Woodward Last updated Mon 13 Feb 2017 Animals Hertfordshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:26:36.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
