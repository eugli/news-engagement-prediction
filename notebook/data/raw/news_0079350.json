That topped his previous worst outing without making a 3 when he went 0 for 10 from distance on Nov. 4 against the Lakers. The two-time reigning MVP entered leading the league by a wide margin with 231 3-pointers this season. \nCurry still had 19 points, making 7 of 12 2-point attempts and all five of his free-throw tries. \nKlay Thompson scored 21 points and Draymond Green had 14 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and five steals for the Warriors, who opened a five-game East Coast trip by winning their fourth straight and boosting their NBA-best record to 50-9. Durant returned after missing a game with a right hand injury. \nDario Saric had 21 points for Philadelphia, which once again played without big man Joel Embiid. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
