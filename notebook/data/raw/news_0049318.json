After massacring a peaceful Ukrainian village, Roman and his men go after the downed US planes and the trio of Navy officers who are trying to elude them,\" it reads. \nTaktarov told Radio Sputnik that he refused the offer because it was too political. The film's plot reminded him of the 2001 American action war film Behind Enemy Lines, which was controversial because of its portrayed of the Yugoslav war. \n\"This time, it was a similar project, but Ukraine and Russia, not really any extraordinary or fresh ideas. I think it was a just a money-making project, nothing special,\" Taktarov said. \"In my opinion, the description of the story was quite horrible, and I wrote, 'I can't play this crap, I'm sorry, it's too political,\" he said. © Sputnik/ Kirill Kallinikov 'I'd Rather Starve': Actor Taktarov Turns Down Hollywood Offer to Play Russian Villain in Donbass The actor said that filming a movie on the subject of the Ukraine crisis is too political at the current time, since the conflict in eastern Ukraine is still ongoing.\n\"It's too fresh. Maybe in five or ten years we can do something like that, but now it's too early. We still don't really know what's going on there and I wouldn't make decisions, especially in films.\" \n\"As an actor, I don't like to play a good or bad character. In life, there is no such thing as good or bad. There are always shades of grey, something in between,\" Taktarov said. \nHave you heard the news?
