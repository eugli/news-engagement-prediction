Image caption The singer says she visited the Jungle in hope of \"humanising\" the people living there. \nShe spoke out about the Calais migrant crisis last year, apologising for what she deemed to be a lack of action on the part of the UK government. \nShe has since said she had no regrets about using her pop star status to speak out politically despite the trolling she received. \nLily, who has had a string of hits including Smile and The Fear, has now announced she's taking a break from Twitter. \n\"My timeline is full of the most disgusting, sexist, misogynistic, racist ****. Really, new levels. I'm no masochist so I'll be back x,\" she wrote. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:12:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
