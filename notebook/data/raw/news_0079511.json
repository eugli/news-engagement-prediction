In addition to the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra , which we have already presented to you in our hands-on reviews, the Japanese smartphone manufacturer also unveiled the Xperia XZs and XZ Premium. Both shine above all with a new camera. MWC 2017: all the latest announcements \nSmartphones from Sony could score points in the past mainly because of the camera. The 2017 generation is also destined to go beyond the top camera technology to gain customer acceptance. It is also no wonder that this feature is highlighted in Sony's smartphones, because the image sensors from Sony Imaging are now in almost all smartphones on the market. Sony Xperia XZs: The compact XZ \nBack to the Sony Xperia XZs and XZ Premium, which were announced today. The differences between the two smartphones lie mainly in the processor, built-in display, size and battery capacity. One could almost say that the new Xperia XZs is the new Xperia Compact for 2017. The Xperia XZs. / © AndroidPIT \nInside the Xperia XZs, you find the Snapdragon 820. This processor is now 12 months old and has already been replaced by the 821. Its successor, the Snapdragon 835, is already about to start shipping in other phones. Despite its age, the Snapdragon 820 should still be fast enough to provide a fluid Android experience along with the 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory. You can expand the internal memory of the Sony Xperia XZs via a microSD card slot. MicroSD cards up to 2 TB are supported. \nThe display of the Xperia XZs measures 5.2 inches diagonally and comes with Full-HD. The low resolution could help the recharge time, as the battery holds 2,300 mAh, and comes with Doze. But we have to find this out in our full review. RAW format for smartphone photos: is it worth it? Sony Xperia XZ Premium: The 4K smartphone with Snapdragon 835 \nIf a 5.2-inch display with full HD resolution and a 12-month old processor are not enough, the new Xperia XZ Premium could be a good companion for everyday use. The XZ Premium has a 5.5-inch display, which not only has 4K resolution, but also supports HDR. The many pixels of the display are fueled by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 including Adreno 540 GPU. Sony is adding 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory to the modern SoC, which is produced in 10 nm manufacturing technology. The latter can be expanded by up to 2 TB as with the XZs via MicroSD. Xperia XZ Premium will have a Snapdragon 835 and 4K display. / © AndroidPIT \nThanks to the larger dimensions of the smartphone, Sony can put a larger battery in the Xperia XZ Premium. In the XZ Premium, the battery holds 3,230 mAh. As the Snapdragon 835 consumes up to 25 percent less power compared to the 820, the recharge time should be very typical for Sony. But as with the XZs, we also have to wait for a full review. Rapid camera for Xperia XZs and Xperia XZ Premium \nIt was not until February 7, 2017 that Sony Imaging introduced a new image sensor that is capable of recording slow-motion images in Full HD at up to 960 frames per second. To be capable of this, Sony has developed the industry's first three-layer stacked CMOS image sensor . The new DRAM layer is introduced in between the usual two layers to deliver fast readout speeds. The new XZ models have new image sensors. / © AndroidPIT \nThanks to the new image sensor, both new 2017 Xperia XZ models can record slow-motion images at up to 960 fps. Another advantage of the new sensor design is Motion Eye technology. Behind this concept is a kind of \"forward looking\" autofocus and in addition, the unloved rolling shutter effect in videos can be minimized. All this is just pure theory at the moment, but as soon as we get the test devices from Sony, we will definitely check the camera for you.
