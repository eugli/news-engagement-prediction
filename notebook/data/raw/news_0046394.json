I was only at 60 per cent. So I shaved my head,” he told ESPN Brazil. \n“Everybody was only talking about my injury. When I arrived in training with this haircut everybody stopped talking about the injury.” \nIt obviously worked. Ronaldo scored a brace as Brazil beat Germany in the final to claim their fifth world cup. He was also the tournament’s top scorer with eight goals. Ronaldo with the World Cup in 2002.

Hackett believes the lack of support Clattenburg received after the incident made him feel isolated. \n“It’s bad news for English refereeing,” Hackett told The Star. \n“The Premier League has lost the world’s best ref – it’s a massive blow. \n“I think it’s down to poor management. There were incidents when the PGMOL haven’t supported or clarified decisions when they’ve needed to. \n“Mark felt after the Mata incident no-one supported him. He was left high and dry.” Juan Mata (L) and Mark Clattenburg (C).

I have to have my body as similar as possible to his all the time, although there are obvious differences due to the genetics. \n“I have a haircut with his personal hairstyle, Miguel, and I always have to have my hair exactly the same as his. A post shared by Diego Dávila (@didavila23) on May 28, 2016 at 4:01pm PDT \nDavilla also revealed that he and the Real Madrid star have grown closer together while working. \n“My relationship with Cristiano is very good,” he said. \n“It’s true that at the beginning of the work we were more distant, perhaps because of shyness, but over time we got to know each other and I can say that Cristiano is a lovely person. \n“It’s a huge pleasure to work with him. He likes to be with me and I with him. He’s an incredible person.” \nIt remains to be seen whether Davilla will play any part in the TV drama (about Syrian refugees) Ronaldo has reportedly signed up for to star along Angelina Jolie.

It is not my objective at the moment, but I have had some invitations,” Ronaldo said in 2016. CR7 nutmeg embarrasses Lopez \nDEMBELE SWITCHES ALLEGIANCE... AGAIN \nOh the life of a 13-year-old football sensation. \nAfter Celtic starlet Karamoko Dembele switched allegiance from Scotland to train with and represent England’s Under-15s side, he has made another backflip on his international future. \nDembele has chosen to once again represent Scotland, the nation he’s made two appearances for at Under-16s level, and has been called up as one of the 20 players to represent the country in a UEFA development tournament this month.

Do you think it was a red card because it was Balotelli? It’s ridiculous,” Favre said, as quoted by L’Equipe. \n“If there is enough for a red card, they send off, if there is not enough, they do not send off.” Balotelli's strange send off \nDIMITAR BERBATOV RECALLS BEST SPURS MOMENTS \nThis is gold from former Spurs and United striker Dimitar Berbatov. \nDressed to impress, the Bulgarian recounted his favourite Tottenham moments. \nEnjoy the video posted by Match of the Day.
