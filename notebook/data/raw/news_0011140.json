Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... Katherine Molnar-Kimber, PhD, a retired research associate professor from the University of Pennsylvania, didn’t let a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis at age 14 stop her from living life. She loves the outdoors and managed flares with hiking, yoga and swimming. But 15 years ago, at 48, her symptoms of RA suddenly got worse, and standard therapies no longer worked. “It felt like somebody was stabbing me in my joints with daggers and needles,” Molnar-Kimber says. “At a particularly low point, I slept on the train ride to and from work and walked with a cane.” A career scientist, she focused her shrewd, problem-solving mind on RA. A s a teenager, Katherine Molnar-Kimber was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes painful swelling and stiffness in the joints, fever and fatigue. Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... “As an immunologist, I researched and published articles on many diseases,” she says. “I turned the same scientific rigor to finding relief from an extremely persistent, painful RA flare.” Since then, Molnar-Kimber has devoted much of her professional life to researching and writing about RA. On her website, rheumatoid-arthritis-decisions.com , she discusses her personal journey with rheumatoid arthritis treatments and provides information on traditional and alternative remedies for RA, as well as research updates. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber discusses her experience with RA and offers practical tips and coping advice to other women living with the disease. Do you know what triggered your symptoms of RA and was your doctor able to diagnose it right away? My adult rheumatoid arthritis probably developed after I broke my wrist doing gymnastics at age 14. My right ring finger became swollen occasionally for no apparent reason. It took about two years to find a physician who diagnosed the finger and tender wrist. A s a teenager, Katherine Molnar-Kimber was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes painful swelling and stiffness in the joints, fever and fatigue. Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... What triggers your RA flares now? I’m sensitive to some foods, so I try to avoid them. I’ve also found that eating organic and unprocessed foods without preservatives or artificial sweeteners helps eliminate flares. If I eat something that bothers me, I get my body to digest it faster by eating foods with lots of digestive enzymes, such as pineapple. Perfume is another trigger for me. Someone sitting near me at a ballet performance was wearing it, so I put a tissue over my nose and drank a lot of water to flush it out. I’m also sensitive to formaldehyde in new rugs and exhaust – I start to feel dizzy and lightheaded. Some RA patients flare from exposure to certain foods, infections, chemicals, stress and trauma [and] may have difficulty resolving the flare due to underlying nutritional deficiencies. They may need more nutrients to resolve these infections.

Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... Which foods or nutrients help you with flares? Most RA patients have low levels of glutathione, an antioxidant produced by the liver that helps neutralize toxins, bad bacteria, viruses and environmental toxins. I try to eat foods that stimulate the liver to produce more glutathione, such as watermelon, parsley, cantaloupes, spinach and members of the cabbage family, including kale, Brussels sprouts, collards and broccoli. What can others do to prevent flares? One way to help hone in on your personal triggers and prevent flares is to keep a daily health journal that tracks your activities, diet, medications, emotional framework and even the weather. Can lifestyle changes alone ease symptoms of RA? I don’t think of lifestyle changes and drugs as either/or options. You can make these modifications while taking meds. If you’re looking for information on deciding which medications to try, rheumatoid-arthritis-decisions.com offers lists of questions to ask your doctor about drugs. Some lifestyle changes that help include drinking enough fluids, taking minerals, eating healthy and exercising regularly. Studies have shown that taking 5 grams (g) of omega-3 oils with medications more than doubled the chance of remission.

Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... What qualities should women with RA look for in their rheumatologists? Are other types of doctors helpful too? Talk with a physician or other health-care provider who has an open mind and who sees the relationship as a partnership. Most rheumatologists aren’t familiar with environmental sensitivities that some people with RA may develop. In those cases, a physician who’s a specialist in environmental medicine can provide useful insights. What’s your view on alternative medicine to treat or heal RA? I’m a strong supporter of exercise and food based-nutrition (rather high doses of just a few nutrients). Our bodies evolved eating foods that have small amounts of many nutrients. Some nutrients can’t be synthesized, such as B4, which is important for cardiovascular health.Whenever possible, I eat organically raised, locally produced foods such as wild salmon or sardines, walnuts, and if inclined, meat from pasture-raised animals rather than grain-fed animals. However, you should discuss [your diet] with your health-care provider. A s a teenager, Katherine Molnar-Kimber was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes painful swelling and stiffness in the joints, fever and fatigue. Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... Also, consider making only one change at a time so you can [see] whether it’s helping your body heal or increasing symptoms. Remember, what works for one person may not necessarily work for you. Research shows that RA may be genetic, and you have a teenage daughter. What’s your advice to mothers with RA? It’s a personal preference. The most important thing for mothers to remember is that just because they have the disease doesn’t mean their daughters or sons will get it. Only one out of five women with a genetic predisposition to RA gets it. In studies of identical twins, only 20% of both twins get the disease. My daughter is 14, and last year she asked me about RA. I asked her if she wanted to see a rheumatologist. She said no because it would just make her more anxious, so we’ve decided not to.

Then, 10 years ago, a debilitating flare inspired her to apply her PhD in immunology to learning more about RA. In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... The best thing you can do as a parent with RA is encourage your children to eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, avoid smoking and drinking, get regular exercise and steer clear of pesticides. This has helped my daughter understand that she can actually do something to prevent the disease. Now, instead of asking for potato chips, she asks for an apple. Are there any new research findings on rheumatoid arthritis treatments? There are two important breakthroughs, including the discovery of new cells called TH17 cells and another finding on the role of mast cells in RA. TH17 cells play an important role in clearing infection, but in excess, they drive chronic autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and RA. In one study, Yale University researchers found that TH17 cells could be redirected into the small intestine and controlled there.Mast cells help protect you from disease and promote wound healing by releasing substances called mediators (histamine and prostaglandins), which they also release during an allergic reaction. A study conducted at Harvard and Brigham Young Universities found that mast cells may play a role in RA by recruiting inflammatory cells to joints. This supports the idea that an allergy or infection can trigger the disease. (For example, a food allergy or sensitivity to environmental toxins.)

In this Lifescript exclusive, Molnar-Kimber shares what she knows now about rheumatoid arthritis treatments... Do you think there will be a cure for RA in the next 25 years? Although I don’t expect scientists will find a single medication, nutrient or lifestyle change that cures every RA patient, I absolutely think that a cure can and will be found for many patients within 25 years or less. Some laboratories report the resolution of RA symptoms in about 10% [of patients] within the first two years. The tough part is figuring out which potential thing will provide the most benefit for each patient and heal them. What advice can you give to those with symptoms of RA? The National Institutes of Health reports that RA patients who are well informed about the disease and participate actively in their own care experience less pain and make fewer visits to the doctor. Think for yourself, because the best treatment options for you may not be the most popular. Watch and listen to your body to see if the new treatment helped after taking it. Physicians and rheumatologists can offer suggestions of promising therapies, but you need to make the choice. Forty years ago, a talented, compassionate and brilliant physician advised me, “You are young, Kathy. You only have one body that you need for the rest of your life. Take care of it.” I suggest any woman with RA do the same. For more expert advice and information, visit our Rheumatoid Arthritis Health Center .
