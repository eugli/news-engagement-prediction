Nelson's Finn Delany, 21, steps up to keep playoff hopes alive MARC HINTON Last updated 16:30, February 11 2017 Sky Sport \n21-year-old Finn Delany played the game of his life to lead the Breakers to a massive 88-70 victory over a disappointing Melbourne United. \nIf you picked Finn Delany as the man to step up and possibly save the NZ Breakers' Australian National Basketball League season, well done. \nWith hard-nosed skipper Mika Vukona a late defection with a knee infection, someone had to provide the inspiration for the Breakers as they played for their postseason lives at the North Shore Events Centre. \nWell, 21-year-old Delany, with solid help from 24-year-old Shea Ili – both in their first campaigns as fully contracted players – played the games of their lives to lead their team to a massive 88-70 victory over a disappointing Melbourne United. GETTY \nFinn Delany celebrates on his way to a crucial 13 points for the Breakers. \nBoth went for career-highs, Delany with an athletic 13 points (as well as nine rebounds, four of them off the offensive glass), and Ili 12 (3-of-3 from deep) in a well-balanced Breakers scoring effort that saw six players post double-figures. \nREAD MORE: * Mitchell defection a blow \nIn front of a full house of 4000, delighted with the fight and fire demonstrated by their drastically undermanned side, the Breakers, with a seventh straight home victory over the men from Melbourne, finished the regular season with a 14-14 record. ANTHONY AU-YEUNG/GETTY IMAGES \nBreakers guard Shea Ili battles Melbourne's Chris Goulding for possession at the NSEC. \nDelany, an 198cm forward from Nelson, brimmed with the confidence of a man beyond his years as he slammed down dunk after dunk. \nTime will tell if it's enough to squeeze into the top-four as the rest of the final round unfolds, but the Breakers have at least given themselves a shot. It all now depends on who else gets to that 14-win mark, or even beyond, in a blanket finish. \nThe defending champion Perth Wildcats routed the Sydney Kings 101-74 later on Friday night, meaning the Breakers will sweat on Melbourne beating the Wildcats in the final game of the regular season on Sunday. That's now a must in any equation that gets the Kiwi club into the playoffs, though a Cairns win in Adelaide on Saturday night would also help. \nIt was a fabulous effort from Paul Henare's men who simply willed themselves to victory, and did a fantastic defensive job on Melbourne, who could not find an answer. The visitors shot a poor 36 per cent from the floor, and never made the run all expected. Sharpshooter Chris Goulding, enveloped by Ili all night, went a cold 2-of-12 from the floor. Ad Feedback \nKevin Dillard paced the Breakers with 16 points, though he shot just 4-of-16. He added five boards and eight assists, and was the creative spark for much of the game. \nKirk Penney added 15 points (5/19 FG, 2/11 3pt) and seven boards, Alex Pledger had 12 (all in the first half) and six rebounds and Paul Carter 10 as the Breakers ran away with the contest with a 30-17 final quarter. The home side made 11 triples to just five from the visitors and that combined with a 53-42 rebounding edge (17-9 at the offensive end) was crucial. \nMelbourne point guard Casper Ware topped all scorers with 23 points, but his was a lone hand for a United side that will be deeply disappointed with its effort and execution. \n\"I'm extremely proud, extremely happy for the group. What they've been through this season, and throughout the last few weeks, they've just taken everything in their stride and been an absolute pleasure to coach,\" said a rapt Henare afterwards. \n\"To see them come out and play the way they did, and to see guys like Finn and Shea and everyone who stepped on the floor tonight embrace the moment, and the situation, was really special.\". \nHenare said he told his young players that Vukona's setback became a huge opportunity for them, and he urged them to seize it. \n\"Each and every one of the guys who stepped on the floor had a massive impact on the game. Whether the guys were playing for Mika or not, I think Mika will be sitting in that hospital bed really proud of his team.\" \nHenare confirmed Vukona had spent the previous two nights in the hospital dealing with his infection, and would remain there over the weekend under observation. \n\"It became a serious situation and we thought he was going to have surgery today to try sort that out. Fortunately it healed enough where he didn't have to go under the knife.\" \nDelany said when he learned his mentor was out, it became a pretty simple mindset. \n\"With Mika out, it's a collective to step up as a team,\" Delany said. \"I think we did a great job of it. The attitude didn't really change − just give energy and do what we all can. I'm sure Mika will be proud of the boys.\" \nIt was just the fifth game Vukona had missed in 10 years, and 324 appearances, as a fully contracted player at the club and was dreadful luck for a group that had already had more than its fair share of ill fortune, with Akil Mitchell the latest injury defection earlier in the week when he dashed back to the US to seek further treatment for his injured eye. \nThat left the Breakers without either of their regular power forwards, and Henare needing a smoke-and-mirrors approach to guide his skinny rotation through a major challenge. \nHe did a fantastic job of it, with the Breakers going toe-to-toe with the visitors, and leading by three (21-18) after one, all tied up (38-38) at the major break, and sneaking out by 58-53 at the three-quarter mark. \nThe Breakers were aided by an outstanding first half from Pledger who made five of his six shots for 12 points and added four rebounds and a pair of assists. It was heady stuff from the seven-footer. \nFoul trouble hit the Breakers in the third quarter with Tom Abercrombie and Pledger both picking up their third, but the Auckland club hung tough and kept making enough shots to put some distance on the visitors by the end of the period. \nWhen Penney dropped his second three-pointer, with 6:10 remaining in the third, that took him to 3000 points for the Breakers, the first player in club history to reach that plateau. \nThen Delany came alive in the final period with three straight dunks at one staging taking the Breakers out by 10 inside the first three minutes. You could just feel Melbourne getting tight, with fouls (Pledger and Abercrombie by then had both picked up their fourth) seemingly the only thing that could undo the hosts. \nLater Ili stepped up to nail two huge triples, and it was then a matter of how much, not how. The Breakers stay alive. For now. \nNZ Breakers 88 (Kevin Dillard 16, Kirk Penney 15, Finn Delany 13, Alex Pledger 12, Shea Ili 12, Paul Carter 10) Melbourne United 70 (Casper Ware 23, David Andersen 10, Josh Boone 10). 1Q: 21-18; HT: 38-38; 3Q: 58-53 - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:31:17.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
