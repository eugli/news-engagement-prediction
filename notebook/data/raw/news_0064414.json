Photo: AP \nA day after claiming a career-best six wickets, the 32-year-old backed it up with another six wickets, including the prized scalp of Kohli, who was on the verge of combustion. \nSmith could not have picked a more opportune moment to post his maiden Test ton in India and stamp his mark on the series. He arrived at the crease amid a flurry of wickets and rode his luck to not just settle his team's nerves but play them into an unassailable position. \nThe contrast between Smith and Kohli's fortunes could not be more stark. The pressure has already affected Kohli's thought process – how else to explain his decision to shoulder arms to a straight one from O'Keefe, a man who is not a big turner of the ball, for 13 to go with his duck in the first innings. His total of 13 this match is the fewest he has scored in a home Test. \nIt was another dominant day for the visitors, who have defied the odds and given the world No.1 a lesson on how to play in their own backyard. \nThey batted with purpose, bowled intelligently and held their chances whereas India have been sloppy and daft, particularly with their use of reviews. India are already paying the price for the the six lives they gave Smith but the real toll of their ineptitude may not become evident until later this series. \nMuch has been made about the aura Kohli has built, though Smith has also compiled a record that should strike fear into the hearts of every international attack. \nThis was his 18th century in the baggy green and his 10th as Test captain: only the peerless Don Bradman and Sri Lanka's maestro Mahela Jayawardene have taken fewer innings than Smith's 37 to reach the milestone. \nMichael Clarke described it as the best of Smith's career while Shane Warne called it an \"excellent captain's knock\". \n\"That's one to cherish, what a hundred,\" Warne said on the Star Sports commentary. \"Its unbelievable really considering it was not that long ago he was batting eight and nine and bowling leg spin. It's a wonderful hundred for his team, for himself and something he will always remember – just a fantastic innings. He's been busy, put the bad ball away, taken singles, had some luck, yep, but he deserved it and made India pay.\" \nThe praise is thoroughly deserved. By promoting himself to No.3, Smith – whose leadership has come of age since the Hobart debacle – put himself in the line of fire, taking the responsibility from his less accomplished teammates to take control of the match. \nSmith's 109 stood out like a sore thumb on a scorecard where no other Australian came close to making 50. \nIt did not come without plenty of charity from the Indians, who put down four chances in the field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:02:56.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
