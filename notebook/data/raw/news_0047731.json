'I look upon my niece and nephew, upon the children who will inherit the future we are creating right now and my conscience tells me to act.' A plan to build a third runway at Heathrow was chosen in October as the Government's preferred option for increasing capacity in south-east England. The demonstration caused huge tailbacks between junction 4 and 4a on the M4 (pictured) Police said they expected the congestion to clear by midday but motorists described it as 'bumper to bumper' An additional 260,000 take-off or landings will be permitted each year from the expanded airport, up from the current cap of 480,000, according to a draft National Policy Statement (NPS) on aviation released last month. A final NPS is expected to be voted on by Parliament in winter 2017/18, following a consultation. Motorists described being stuck in 'bumper to bumper' traffic because of the demonstration. Air France employee Ryan McGuire said on Twitter: 'Stuck in this #Heathrow traffic. It's bumper to bumper. Anyone know what the protest is about? It was Black Lives Matter last time.' Those stuck in traffic around Heathrow airport hit out at the protesters after the demonstration sparked travel chaos Another Twitter user named Rosh said: 'Whilst I'm all for movements, protesting at #Heathrow and making people miss their flights doesn't seem like the best way to get support..' Pro-expansion group Back Heathrow called the demonstration 'selfish, short-sighted and counter-productive'. They said: 'Most local communities living near Heathrow support expansion and passengers simply want to be able to use the airport in peace. 'This pointless protest will merely aggravate thousands of ordinary people, many of whom simply want to get to work or catch a flight.' The Metropolitan police said: 'A contra-flow is in place in the outbound tunnel to facilitate the movement of traffic around the blocked tunnel (which is now empty), but motorists are advised possible delays to their journey as this incident is dealt with.' A spokesman for Heathrow airport said: 'Heathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues together with the smooth running of the operation is paramount.' He advised passengers to allow more time to drive into terminals two and three.
