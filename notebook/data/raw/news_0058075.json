Fourth… more Courtesy Linville Team Partners The historic former Woolworth’s building in downtown Winston-Salem, which houses the city’s chamber of commerce on the top floor, is about to undergo a $4 million renovation scheduled for completion by the end of the year. LTP Holdings II LLC, an investment group put together by Linville Team Partners , purchased the three-floor, 39,000-square-foot building at 411 W. Fourth St. in November. Last month, interior demolition of the first two floors was completed. A rendering of the future exterior of the former Woolworth's building at 411 W. Fourth… more Courtesy Linville Team Partners LTP partner Coleman Team , manager of the investment group, said he expects the street-level middle level to be renovated and occupied by two retail tenants — one a 6,080-square-foot, \"unique all-day restaurant\" — this summer. Team said his firm had letters of intent on both retail spaces, which will have separate entrances from the street. “We should have leases signed in the next 20 days,” he said. Team said general contractor GEMCAP Construction should have a spec renovation of two downstairs office suites with conference rooms ready for tenants by December. He said tenants would be able to customize offices. The Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce , which moved into the building at the corner of West Fourth and Spruce Street in 2013, will remain as a tenant on the top floor. Team said the street level, last used as a food court, has been vacant for the past three years. The building has not been named, according to Team. It was dubbed Winston-Salem Chamber Plaza when the chamber moved in. The design from architectural firm Stitch Design Shop is planned to be bright and open. All the existing doors and windows will be stripped out. Three 18-foot wide, rectangular windows will provide more natural light. The focus point of the white exterior will be an awning wrapping around the corner. The bottom floor, which will include a second kitchen for the restaurant, will have window wells to bring in sunlight. Two staircases to the bottom level will empty out into a “landing area” with a common seating area with televisions and Wifi access. Much of the office space will be visible through glass walls. “We ripped everything out,” Team said. “The interior will be wide-open with a lot of glass.” The renovation of the building is the latest in a trend of developments in the area. Recent projects on Fourth Street include Twin City Lofts , across the street in the former JCPenney building, and the renovation of the Nash-Bolich Building, the new home of Garner Foods corporate office , only two blocks away. “There’s been a big transformation downtown,” Team said. \"But we feel the real meat of it is just getting started. Downtown should continue to grow, especially the retail element.”   John Brasier covers development, commercial and residential real estate, construction and retail.
