Draymond Green said after all the controversy about his various incidents of legs-gone-awry that he wouldn’t change his approach at all. And he hasn’t. Green has been involved with several incidents involving flailing feet this season, and on Thursday, added another to his highlight reel, this time nearly kicking Blake Griffin in the head.

And to a degree, you’re right. James Harden accidentally kicked DeMarcus Cousins on Thursday night on a shot attempt. It happens constantly in the field of play. But that’s across hundreds of players and thousands of possessions. Not with the regularity and consistency that it happens with Green. \nEither way, you have another entry in the “Draymond Green kicks people” file.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:49:20.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
