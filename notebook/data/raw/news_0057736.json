An area of the brain involved in language and speech production known as Broca's area , is located in the left frontal lobe. The prefrontal cortex is the front portion of the frontal lobes and manages complex cognitive process such as planning, reasoning, and problem-solving. This area of the frontal lobes functions to help us set and maintain goals, curb negative impulses, and form our individual personalities. \nThe primary motor cortex of the frontal lobes is involved in voluntary movement. It has nerve connections with the spinal cord , which enable this brain area to control muscle movements. The premotor cortex of the frontal lobes has neural connections with the primary motor cortex, spinal cord, and brainstem . The premotor cortex enables us to plan and perform proper movements in response to external cues. Frontal Lobe Damage \nDamage to the frontal lobes can result in a number of difficulties such as a loss of fine motor function, speech and language processing difficulties, thinking difficulties, an inability to comprehend humor, a lack of facial expression, and changes in personality. Frontal lobe damage can also result in dementia, memory disorders, and a lack of impulse control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:37:26.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
