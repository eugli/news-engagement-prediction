The annual event marked the Great Siege victory of 1565. Photo: Daniel Cilia/Heritage Malta \nA request to the French authorities to hand over the de Valette dagger for keeps, to have it on permanent display in Malta, is not being excluded by the government. \nThe dagger and an ornamental sword – both given to Grand Master Jean de Valette by King Philip II of Spain shortly after the Great Siege of 1565 in recognition of the Order of St John’s victory against the Ottoman Empire – were seized by the French during their brief but controversial two-year colonial rule at the end of the 18th century. \nTwo centuries later, this incident still fuels controversy, even among some historians, who believe that the French authorities are morally bound return the items, which have huge historical importance. Despite calls to return them, including an online petition, the ornamental weapons are still at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where they have been since 1840. \nThe debate was reignited two days ago when Heritage Malta announced that the dagger would be brought to Malta for the first time since 1798 and put on display for a three-month period, to the end of June. The exhibition will be part of the events marking Malta’s EU presidency during the first half of this year. \nContacted by this newspaper, Culture Minister Owen Bonnici yesterday did not rule out the possibility of filing an official request to the French authorities to hand over the dagger permanently. \n“The government is always willing to open negotiations to return items which had been taken away from Malta [during colonial times]. However, much depends on the other side,” he said, \nDr Bonnici remarked that the issue had recently been raised in a meeting with the French culture minister, but the latter did not commit herself. \n“Their policy is to consider any such request and decide accordingly. It would be nice if this dagger remained in Malta on a permanent basis. We made the first step by bringing it over temporarily.” \nDr Bonnici expressed his wish that the three-month exhibition would raise greater awareness on de Valette’s legacy. He is also remembered as the founder of Malta’s capital, which bears his surname. \nHowever, the prospects of bringing the sword back to Malta are very slim, even on a temporary basis. \n“I am informed that the sword is in a very bad state of preservation and any attempt to transport it could result in permanent damage,” Dr Bonnici told this newspaper. \nFor more than two centuries, up until 1797, the ornamental dagger and sword were displayed during a procession held every year on September 8, the anniversary of the day that the Great Siege had been lifted.
