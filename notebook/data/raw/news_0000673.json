(Don Markus/Baltimore Sun video) Ron Fritz coach DJ Durkin accomplished with his 2017 recruiting class. Here's what some are saying:\n\nUSA Today had Maryland as its No. 1 surprise on signing day: \nD.J. Durkin and his assistant coaches worked tirelessly to sign perhaps the nation’s most surprisingly effective recruiting class. Need to rebuild your roster? The Terrapins did just that in signing more than two dozen prospects from their own backyard — Maryland, Virginia and New Jersey — and as far away as California. It’s a hard road to the top of the Big Ten East Division, but Maryland took a drastic step forward. \n\nScout.com had Maryland at No. 12 nationally, one spot ahead of NotreDame and two ahead of Penn State : \nBrowse photos of Baltimore metro-area athletes signing with schools on Feb. 1, 2017. \nDJ Durkin proved his recruiting mettle by selling the Terps, a consistently middling program, to several high-profile recruits. Getting running back Cordarrian Richardson may give Maryland the exposure the program has needed for years. If this class is any indication, Durkin was a home-run hire last season. \n\nTom Dienhart of the Big Ten Network listed the Terps as his big surprise in the Big Ten: \nWhen DJ Durkin got the Maryland job in 2016, we heard a lot about his recruiting prowess. We saw glimpses of his acumen on the recruiting trail this time last year. Now, with over a year to recruit, Durkin unleashed his sales skills on the nation by signing what may be the top class in school annals. A big key: Keeping local talent home in an area Durkin calls the “DMV,” D.C., Maryland and Virginia, a fertile recruiting region he wants to own. The Terps have the No. 4 class in the Big Ten despite going 6-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:45:24.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
