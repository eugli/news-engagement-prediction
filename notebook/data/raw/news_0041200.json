Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Connor Cox thought his mum had sent him some nice things in the post.\nThe 18-year-old, from Leonardtown, Maryland, is studying at Westminster College in Pennsylvania, away from the trappings of parental influence. Or so he thought.\nA few weeks ago, Connor received a surprise box in the post. He thought he'd got himself a 'care package' post-Christmas, full of bits of bobs to help him manage. You know, mums. Being nice. Looking after their children.\n“I was thrilled, because it’s like Christmas when you get mail from family when you’re in college,” Connor told BuzzFeed News .\nConnor was excited about his box. He tore it open, and found what he thought was some sort of 'wrapping' covering what lay beneath. But it wasn't wrapping at all. It was tissue. Used tissue . And lots of other dirty rubbish.\nHis mum had sent him all the rubbish he'd not bothered to clean up from his room at home, which had accumulated over the holiday break.\nMum Terri said: “I have raised and taught Connor better than this, and his actions deserve consequences.\"\nTerri said that she and Connor had implemented an agreement over the holidays. It was a simple one: he'd tidy up and do some chores while back from university.\nRead More Police 'marinade naked Devon man' as he runs around with tree branch But Connor thought he'd cunningly swerved his duties: “I guess I thought I could get away with it all and have her clean it up, but she showed me otherwise.\n“Most of the trash was hidden in my clothes drawers,” he said. Bit weird.\nConnor shared his upsetting 'care package' on Twitter, where his sister got involved.\nTerri was apparently very proud of her box: “His room should be left the way it was when he came home for Christmas break, which I cleaned before he came home,” she said.\nRead More Popular parent bloggers Reality of shopping with your partner Mum's rant about praising kids 10 reasons toddlers are terrors 'My first child broke my vagina' Telling off other people's children Taking your baby on holiday Shattered mum's baby sleep guide Peppa Pig's mum should take a break Thrifty mum's Christmas tips 'Kids should take care of themselves' How this mum of three has sex every day 5 things to do before baby arrives Dad steps into mum's shoes for one day A heartfelt defence of single mothers Mum gives birth live on Facebook Mum's shares struggle with breastfeeding Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorWeirdNews Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Education Schools Parenting", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorWeirdNews", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/terri-not-here-to-play-games?utm_term=.tqVl4yKl8#.qu3X1D8Xg"], "published": "2017-02-19T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:00:58.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
