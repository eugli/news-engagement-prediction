It clearly moved him. Moved him to correct it, that is. \nHe began with the first page . \"Too long of an introduction. Lots of repetition,\" he noted. He worried about the lack of indents too. \nThis sentence written by his ex might be familiar to many: \"you know the saying 'you never know how much you had till it's gone'? that's how I feel. I took you for granted.\" \nShe added: \"I ended up falling on my part.\" \n\"How?\" Lutz wrote in red in response. \"Need Reasoning here.\" \nOh, Nick. This is love. Reasoning plays no part. \nYou'll be wondering why these two split up. There might be a clue in her sentence: \"There is one thing I never did to you no matter if you believe me or not -- I never cheated on you.\" \nTo this, Lutz offered a big, red question mark and the words: \"Strong statement. No supporting Details to support your hypothesis.\" \nAnd so it went on, until Lutz gave her 61 out of a 100. A grade of D-. \nSomehow, Twitter's eyes fell upon this and it flew about the site. Currently, it's enjoyed more than 100,000 retweets and 300,000 likes. \nMany Twitterers came to his defense, some choosing to point out mistakes that Lutz had missed. \n\"ok should have failed her,\" wrote Dr. Petty Spaghetti. \"You missed that she listed 'a lot' as one word in her intro.\" More Technically Incorrect", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:09:02.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
