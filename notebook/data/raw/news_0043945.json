That was my motivation to come back home, to my community and to my school.”\nCass Tech's efficiency was apparent around the rim, particularly with shots from senior Leonard Silas.\nSilas had a highlight-worthy finish to open the fourth quarter after King cut Cass Tech's lead to 40-36.\nKing wasn't nearly as efficient, shooting 34.1 percent. The Crusaders (14-4) trailed 21-17 with 3:55 left in the second quarter.\n“We’ve been giving up 52 points per game this year, and defense is something that we identify ourselves with,” Hall said. “Not just today, but all season, we’ve been doing a good job of defending.”\nKemon Bassett led King with 13 points.\nGirls King 56, Mumford 33: Senior Tia Tedford scored a game-high 17 points as the Crusaders (18-1) toppled the Lady Mustangs (13-6) and claimed their sixth consecutive PSL title.\nKing never trailed after the 4:04 mark in the first quarter.\nDonnetta Colbert led Mumford with 10 points.\nMore girls scores\nDetroit Community 73, Detroit Henry Ford Academy 29: In the Metro B division title game, Passion Hargrove led all scorers with 24 points, and Alana Jackson added 15 points and 14 rebounds for Community.\nRiver Rouge 56, Detroit Consortium 30: Moriyah Hamell had 17 points, seven rebounds and eight steals for River Rouge (14-4).
