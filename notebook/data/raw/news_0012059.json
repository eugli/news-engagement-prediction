Do we think someone was politely asked to put on a jacket this afternoon? pic.twitter.com/Fojta8g4JD \n— Peter Ford (@mrpford) February 6, 2017 Uh oh, will @AmberSherlock crack it again?\nLooks like the lady on the right didn't have time to get her arms through the jacket. #jacketgate pic.twitter.com/5istOG9cPo \n— Farrah Mu (@farrahmu) February 6, 2017 Hi @AmberSherlock ,\nDid you make her put that jacket on, or is blue on green \"a thing\". #JacketGate pic.twitter.com/EwCzugOtY7 \n— Battling Lefty (@murzo_4) February 6, 2017 OMG Kelly must have run out & put the blue jacket on @AmberSherlock #AvoidAbuse \n— N C Warland (@sunshinebeach25) February 6, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:05:13.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
