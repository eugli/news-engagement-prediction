Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWetherspoon is to become the first pub chain in the country to tell punters how many calories their drinks contain. \nMany food chains already tell customers how many calories are in the meals they sell. \nBut now the low-cost pub is to make sure they know just how much they are consuming when boozing too. \nHealth bosses have long warned that alcohol is a significant factor behind rising levels of obesity. A pint of Stella Artois has 227 calories (Photo: Getty) \nStudies have shown alcohol is often followed by overeating. \nMany people are also unaware of how many calories are contained in alcoholic drinks. \nA pint of Stella Artois has 227 calories and a pint of Guinness 204. \nRed wine is not much better, containing 198 calories in 250ml of Malbec \nWhite wine is marginally less calorific, with a glass of Chardonnay containing 178. \nA man needs an average of 2,500 kcals per day while a woman needs 2,000. \nThe new calorie information will be rolled out in new menus at Wetherspoon next month, according to The Sun.
