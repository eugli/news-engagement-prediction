Writing in his column in The Times , Souness said: 'Ozil copped most of the criticism. Should we be surprised? Not really. The German is Arsenal in a nutshell. 'Against the Crystal Palaces of this world, he is an absolute worldie player. Against the big boys of the Premier League and Europe, he is an absolute world away. Graeme Souness believes Ozil has proved he is unable to produce his best in the big games 'Just remember that this is a Â£42m player we are discussing. Is this what Real Madrid saw when they decided to sell him? Had they spotted the flaw? He was nearly 25 when he moved from the Bernabeu. That is when a player should be in his prime. 'I used to think Arsenal were only a couple of world-class players away from winning the title, most notably a holding midfielder and striker. Now they look as many as five or six away from being contenders.' The defeat in Munich has brought further questions over the future of manager Wenger, who insisted he will make a decision over his role at the the Emirates in 'March or April'. Ozil's agent, Dr Erkut Sogut told the BBC his player feels he has become a scapegoat for the club's shortcomings: 'Criticism is normal if a player plays badly, but Mesut feels people are not focusing on his performance; they are using him as a scapegoat for the team after bad results. Souness says Ozil's shortcomings are typical of the issues Arsenal are suffering with as a club 'Bayern had 74 per cent possession. How can someone in the No 10 position create chances if you don't have the ball? Was he the reason that Arsenal conceded five goals? 'In these games people usually target a player who cost a lot of money and earns a lot of money - that is Mesut. But he can't be always be the scapegoat. That's not fair.' The defeat in Munich has led to further questions over Wenger's future at The Emirates. While many pundits have insisted it is time for the Frenchman to walk away from the club he had led for 20 years, Wenger insisted he will be managing 'somewhere' next season no matter what.
