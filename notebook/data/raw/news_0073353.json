(Paul Drinkwater/Courtesy of NBC/Handout via Reuters) \nEven before Meryl Streep has hit the red carpet, there’s been some dress drama between her and designer Karl Lagerfeld. \nIn an interview with WWD , the Chanel creative director said he had been working on a dress for the iconic actress but was told to stop because Streep had found a designer who would pay her to wear a different frock. Lagerfeld has since said in a statemen t that he “misunderstood” what happened between him and Streep’s team, which has said lack of payment had nothing to do with switching designers, and “[I] regret this controversy.” \nStreep is not pleased with Lagerfeld or WWD, and she’s responded to attempts to walk back the story with a statement of her own : “In reference to Mr. Lagerfeld’s ‘statement,’ there is no ‘controversy’: Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication. That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record-breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience. I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld’s generic ‘statement’ of regret for this ‘controversy’ was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting.” \nAfter his initial interview with WWD, Lagerfeld said , “Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep’s stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards. After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep’s team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:16:27.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
