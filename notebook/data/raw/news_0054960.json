Pruitt was an outspoken critic of the agency's policies during the Obama administration, and the emails shed light on how he fought against its regulations.\nOne email showed that American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers coordinated opposition in 2013 to both the Renewable Fuel Standard Program and ozone limits with Pruitt’s office.\nCMD said the group provided Pruitt with \"template language\" for an Oklahoma petition, under the assumption that the argument \"is more credible coming from a State.\"\nPruitt filed opposition to both the RFS and ozone limits in 2013.\n© AP Photo/Susan Walsh Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt is seen on a television monitor as he speaks to employees of the EPA in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2017. Other emails highlight the apparently close relationship Pruitt had with Devon Energy. The company helped Pruitt draft language in a letter he sent to the EPA about the limiting of methane from oil and gas fracking, according to CMD.\nDevon also helped organize a meeting between Pruitt, coal industry lawyer Paul Seby and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society to create a “clearinghouse” that would “assist AGs in addressing federalism issues.”\nIn another email dated August 2013, Matt Ball, an executive at Americans for Prosperity, sent Pruitt an email thanking him and his “respective bosses and all they are doing to push back against President Obama’s EPA and its axis with liberal environmental groups to increase energy costs for Oklahomans and American families across the states.”\nPruitt was confirmed to head up the EPA after a lengthy floor debate in the Senate. Democrats blasted him for vowing to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations and took issue with past comments he made where he challenged the science behind climate change.\nRepublicans, fed up with overregulation, argued Pruitt was the right candidate to scale back the size and reach of the EPA.\nPruitt delivered his first remarks to EPA employees on Tuesday, urging them to \"avoid\" regulatory \"abuses\" and balance economic and environmental needs .\n“We as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and jobs and we can be pro-environment, and we don’t have to choose between the two,” Pruitt said.\nIt was on the eve of his confirmation that Pruitt was ordered by the judge to turn over more than 2,000 documents. Democrats used the development to push for a delay in the vote, but did not succeed.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed efforts to postpone the vote as another delay tactic by Democrats that was “unprecedented, harmful and pointless.”\nArn Pearson, general counsel for CMD accused the AG's office of trying to \"evade public scrutiny\" by releasing the emails Tuesday night.\nCalls to the EPA and Devon Energy for comment were not immediately returned.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAne2P9?blobrefkey=101&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;180&quot;}", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/6faafa03-819c-40d6-b66e-aadeac48be79/b09c890b-7722-416b-a2c4-201e576a7c33.ism&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1006&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/6faafa03-819c-40d6-b66e-aadeac48be79/b09c890b-7722-416b-a2c4-201e576a7c33.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;htt", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6Dp75.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAne2P9?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;102&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAne2P9?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/02/21/694940094001_5331290147001_5331292377001.mp4&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/22/emails-reveal-epa-chief-pruitts-work-with-oil-gas-companies.html?cmpid=prn_msn&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FOX", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/21/epas-pruitt-urges-officials-to-avoid-regulatory-abuses-in-first-speech-to-staff.html", "http://api.foxnews.com/v1/custom/partner/msn/section/politics&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAne2P9%3focid%3dsl&title=Emails+reveal+EPA+chief+Pruitt%26apos%3bs+work+with+oil%2c+gas+companies&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAne2P9%3focid%3dsl", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAne2P9&lang=en-us&flow_id=5785bb9e-031e-465f-a00d-e4dcd90172f6", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3e1oO.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAne2Yo.img&quot;}}", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAne2P9%3focid%3dst&text=Emails+reveal+EPA+chief+Pruitt%26apos%3bs+work+with+oil%2c+gas+companies&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAne2P9%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA36Tom.img", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAne2P9?blobrefkey=en-us&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;culture&quot;:&quot;en-us&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:14:08.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
