He’s a great talent and he has learned a harsh lesson.”\nCanada’s Davis Cup captain, Martin Laurendeau,, said: “I didn’t see what happened. The game was over and I just heard the crowd go silent all of a sudden. I know something was up. I looked at the referee to see what was going on and he was in the middle of it.\n“He looks like he is going to be OK and that’s the priority here. I’m as surprised as anyone here. It’s a shame for sure.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:26:04.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
