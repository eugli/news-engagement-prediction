It's horrible that something as horrible as this can happen, especially to someone you know,\" another wrote. \nMr Keating's sister, Bree Lyon, told Fairfax Media the family was \"absolutely devastated\". \n\"My dearest angel, one you have always been and will always remain,\" she said about Ms Collie. \n\"From the very moment I met you I loved you, I cherished your genuine heart, and that beautiful smile. I was inspired by you in so many ways, my darling girl, you were so strong and so determined. \n\"I miss you so much, Emily. I truly do. I love how you loved my brother, the way you looked into his eyes with nothing but pure love, it was the truest thing I've ever been grateful to witness. \n\"I promise to look after your Tommy forever and always, our darling girl with those beautiful curls.\" \nLieutenant Patiwat said the owner of the jet-skis the couple rented did not want any payment for damage to the machines, saying \"he wants Phuket to have a good reputation as a holiday destination.\" \nUnder an insurance policy that was taken out for the couple's rental, Ms Collie's family will be entitled to a payment of 50,000 Thai baht ($1867). \nHer parents are travelling to Phuket to collect her body. \nJet-ski operators usually get people to sign a contract but customers are rarely asked questions about whether they have experience riding them. \nUnder Thai law, anyone using a jet-ski is supposed to have a \"captain's permit\" but the law is often overlooked to allow tourists to hire jet-skis. \nThe death comes at a time Thai tourism officials in Bangkok have been pressing Phuket authorities to make the island safer on the roads and in the water. \nBut Phuket lifeguards recently had their budget cut. \nAustralia's smartraveller.gov.au travel advisory warns about the risks of hiring jet-skis and motorcycles on Thai beaches, in particular in Phuket, Pattaya, Koh Samui and Koh Phangan. \n\"You may be detained and arrested by police following jet-ski and motorcycle accidents until compensation, often in the thousands of dollars, can be negotiated between parties,\" the advisory says. \nMany Australians who take out travel insurance policies in Australia find they are not covered when they have a motorcycle accident in Thailand because they are not licensed to ride one in Australia. \nMore than 20,000 Australians holiday on Phuket each month.
