While we can let Nokia play the nostalgia game, the moot question currently is, will such a device still be relevant in a fast-evolving world of technology. In 2017 you will be very lucky to find a phone with a battery big enough to last longer than one day, which makes the one popular, Nokia 3310 a practical superpower. Nokia has just re-launched the classic 3310 handset which was once the most loved and resilient phone. The Nokia 3310 was first unveiled in the year 2000, and it had paved way for a new generation of devices with sturdy bodies and bigger batteries. The Nokia 3310 got re-released at the Mobile World Congress 2017. While we can let Nokia play the nostalgia game, the moot question currently is, will such a device still be relevant in a fast-evolving world of technology.\nNokia, once a pioneer in mobile technology, had tried its hand with Microsoft to jump into the smartphone bandwagon but failed miserably. Now, HMD Global, a Finnish company holds the rights to the Nokia brand and is trying aggressively to enter the mobile phone market by bringing smartphones as well as feature phones. The company launch the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 at the same event, MWC 2017. Along with it, it brought back the famous Nokia 3310, the phone which was once termed as ‘unbreakable’. But is a sturdy body and big battery life enough to sustain a device in the current generation? Well, you may say that you will save on your data pack as the ancient phone itself is incapable of using it.\nHere’s a look at the phone:\nNokia 3310 is one strong phone. Whether you spill your drink on it, or it drops from your hand accidently, the phone can always be assembled back together, and it will work just as fine. But in the fact paced world, people want everything at high speeds, from the internet to functionalities. What can a feature phone do at best- play the radio? Additionally, there are plenty of smartphones available in the market which come really cheap and can still give a better performance than a ‘dumb’ phone. Also, there are many devices these days which come with really big batteries and are modelled around that feature, so why will anyone choose a phone which cannot give much functionality apart from calling. With the arrival of really cheap power banks, the battery feature on Nokia 3310 is even more redundant.\nAlso read | MWC 2017: Nokia 3310 is back along with Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6; here’s what we know so far\nSo, if you do not buy into the nostalgia that Nokia is trying to provide nor do you want a device just for owning a piece of computing history in your pocket, we don’t see why you would go for this phone. While we are all for Nokia’s comeback, we see little reason why they would go for such a strategy in the world as competitive as it is.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FNokiaMobile%2Fvideos%2F487196228335452%2F&show_text=0&width=560"], "published": "2017-02-27T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:18:22.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
