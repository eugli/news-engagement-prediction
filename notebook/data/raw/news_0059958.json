Trump said on Friday a new edict would be announced soon. The administration has been working on a new version that could withstand legal challenges. \nHomeland Security spokeswoman Gillian Christensen on Friday did not dispute the report's authenticity, but said it was not a final comprehensive review of the government's intelligence. \n\"While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you're referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing,\" Christensen said. \n\"The ... report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is incomplete.\" \nThe Homeland Security report is based on unclassified information from Justice Department press releases on terrorism-related convictions and attackers killed in the act, State Department visa statistics, the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment from the US intelligence community and the State Department Country Reports on Terrorism 2015. Ad Feedback \nThe three-page report challenges Trump's core claims. \nIt said that of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to carry out or try to carry out an attack in the United States, just over half were US citizens born in the United States. \nThe others were from 26 countries, led by Pakistan, Somalia, Bangladesh, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iraq and Uzbekistan. Of these, only Somalia and Iraq were among the seven nations included in the ban. \nOf the other five nations, one person each from Iran, Sudan and Yemen was also involved in those terrorism cases, but none from Syria. It did not say if any were Libyan. \nThe report also found that terrorist organisations in Iran, Libya, Somalia and Sudan are regionally focused, while groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen do pose a threat to the US. \nThe seven countries were included in a law President Barack Obama signed in 2015 that updated visa requirements for foreigners who had travelled to those countries. \nChristensen said the countries were also selected in part because they lacked the ability to properly vet their citizens and don't cooperate with US efforts to screen people hoping to come to the US. \nThe report was prepared as part of an internal review Trump requested after his executive order was blocked by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. It was drafted by staff of the Homeland Security Department's Intelligence and Analysis branch at the direction of its acting leader, David Glawe. \nWhite House spokesman Michael Short said this was not the full report that Trump had requested. He said he believes \"the intel community is combining resources to put together a comprehensive report using all available sources, not just open sources, and which is driven by data, not politics\". \nThe intelligence document was circulated beyond Homeland Security. \nThe draft document reflects the tensions between the president's political appointees and the civil servants tasked with carrying out Trump's ambitious and aggressive agenda. Trump has repeatedly complained about leaks meant to undercut his policies and suggested he does not trust holdovers from the Obama administration. \nTrump originally said the ban was necessary to overhaul the vetting system for both refugees and would-be foreign visitors, saying that terrorists may try to exploit weaknesses to gain access to the United States. The order sparked chaos, outrage and widespread protests, with travellers detained at airports and panicked families searching for relatives. \nBut several courts quickly intervened, and the 9th Circuit ultimately upheld a ruling blocking the ban and challenged the administration's claim that it was motivated by terrorism fears. \nTrump's ban temporarily barred citizens from the seven countries from coming to the United States for three months. The order also temporarily shut down the US refugee programme for four months and indefinitely banned anyone from Syria. \nA senior administration official told the AP on Sunday that a draft of the revised order will target those same seven countries. The official would not be named discussing the document before it is made public. \nIn a speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee Friday, Trump reiterated his claims on terrorism. \n\"We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,\" Trump said. \nHe said he singled out the seven countries because they had already been deemed a security concern by the Obama administration. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:21:58.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
