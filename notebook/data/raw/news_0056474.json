(Source: Roblox Corporation) The Canadian Press Published Tuesday, February 21, 2017 4:43PM EST \nTORONTO -- The Canadian Centre for Child Protection is warning parents following reports of sexually suggestive messages being sent through the popular Roblox children's gaming environment. \nRoblox is a user-generated gaming environment where children are encouraged to create adventures using their avatar, play games and connect with friends in a multiplayer environment that claims to more than 44 million active users. \nThe centre says it has received reports about requests to meet in person and sexually suggestive chat messages being sent to children under the age of 12 within Roblox. \nIt says children can easily be exposed to inappropriate conversations or redirected to inappropriate content on other sites through the chat feature. \nIt suggests that before children to start playing a particular game, parents explore it themselves first and possibly turn off the chat component. \nThe centre also says parents should teach children to check with them before using new apps or games or sharing any information online, and not to respond or click on messages or links from someone they don't know.
