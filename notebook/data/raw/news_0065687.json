Here, check out what the film is about... By Pooja Nayak | Published: February 23, 2017 8:30 pm Say what? Mira Rajput invites Shahid Kapoor's ex on his pre-birthday bash? – check out pic \nSo Vishal Bhardwaj’s Rangoon starring Shahid Kapoor , Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan is almost here. Shot extensively in Arunachal Pradesh, the war romance drama is set against World War II when the Japanese Army entered the borders of India. The love triangle featuring is supposedly inspired by the Hollywood classic Casablanca featuring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman; while the music of the film is composed by Vishal Bhardwaj. With such a stellar cast put together, do you think Rangoon will strike a chord with the audience? Is Rangoon going to be the film of the year as tagged by Kareena Kapoor Khan? Here, we give you a quick gist of what the film is all about… \nThe story \nRangoon is a love story that can be called epic in every sense of the word. A beautiful movie actress(Janbaaz Julia played by Kangana) lands in the jungles of India-Burma border in 1944 to entertain Indian and British army troops. Julia abhors handsome Indian soldier Nawab(played by Shahid Kapoor) first but falls for his charm eventually. There’s a love affair that’s forbidden yet pure. She soon learns about the truth of Indian independence. But things get ugly, dark, brutal and bloody when her rich lover Rusi(played by Saif Ali Khan) discovers about their affair and wrecks havoc. Will Julia and Nawab’s love story get a happy ending or was it a short lived affair? Watch the film to know that. \nThe trailer \nTrust only Vishal Bhardwaj to bring out the best in his actors. The three powerhouse performers coming together for a Vishal Bhardwaj film in itself is a dream come true. It was good to see Saif Ali Khan in a Vishal Bhardwaj’s world after his best performance till date in Vishal’s Omkara. Ditto goes for Shahid Kapoor, who has done his best work with Vishal in Haider and Kaminey. Kangana Ranaut as usual is top notch in the trailer. Like Haider ‘s trailer, this one too is high on background score. Cinematography of the film is just breathtaking. Kudos to the makers for recreating the era of World War II in this one. \nWatch, the trailers below: \nMusic review \nWhen the director of the film is also the music composer of the film, music becomes the demand of the story and Rangoon just proves that right. With songs like Bloody Hell, Mere Miyan Gaye England, Tippa and Do Dooni Do Gulzar has penned the Hindi lyrics, while Lekha Washington has written the English ones. Overall, if you are someone who has a refined taste in music, the music of Rangoon may certainly appeal to you, as Vishal Bhardwaj does full justice to the era in which the movie is based. \nBox office predictions \nWe spoke to trade expert Akshaye Rathi to get an idea on how much money will Rangoon make at the box office and he revealed, “The buzz around Rangoon is low, but I still feel that it will easily make Rs 5 crore on day one. It will see a growth over the next couple of days and end with a total collection of Rs 16-17 crore over the first weekend. The cost of production for Rangoon is not less than Rs 40 crore, which is high for such a film. Add to that Rs 15-20 crore in publicity and advertising costs, which takes the bare minimum landing cost to Rs 55-60 crore. To recover that kind of money is going to be tough task. Rangoon is also not a satellite friendly film, so it will earn about Rs 10 crore from that. And to recover the remaining Rs 50 crore, Rangoon needs to make more than Rs 110 crore at the worldwide market, which is quite difficult according to me. So it is a scary situation.” Also read: Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut’s Rangoon to make Rs 17 crore over the first weekend, suggests trade expert \nWhy watch Rangoon? \nRangoon’s trailer made everyone extremely thrilled about the film. The setting, the love, the passion and Kangana’s quirky hunterwali look looks damn enticing. Add to that, Shahid and Kangana’s love story is so steamy yet all-consuming and we love such movies as it involves you in the narrative. And talking about Saif, his rich debonair evil man with panache look further makes us fall in love with his royal charm. He might just recreate the same magic that he did with Bharadwaj’s Omkara. We can sure as well hope. \nDo watch Rangoon and get back to us with your reviews in the comments section below. \nPublished: February 23, 2017 8:30 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:28:30.475+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
