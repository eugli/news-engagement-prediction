And I am with him when it comes to being outraged about him being charged with this anti-Semitism.”\nTurx concluded that after the exchange with Trump, he was “very hopeful.” And that it shows Trump is “committed” against and personally bothered by anti-Semitism.\n(h/t Mediaite )\n TV , anti-semitism , Donald Trump , Jake Turx", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Freporter-who-asked-trump-anti-semitism-question-im-with-trump-being-outraged-over-anti-semitism-charges%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Reporter+Who+Asked+Trump+Anti-Semitism+Question%3A+I%E2%80%99m+%E2%80%98With%E2%80%99+Trump+Being+Outraged+Over+Anti-Semitism+Charges", "http://www.mediaite.com/online/i-understand-why-hes-so-defensive-jewish-reporter-scolded-by-trump-comes-to-his-defense/", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Freporter-who-asked-trump-anti-semitism-question-im-with-trump-being-outraged-over-anti-semitism-charges%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Reporter+Who+Asked+Trump+Anti-Semitism+Question%3A+I%E2%80%99m+%E2%80%98With%E2%80%99+Trump+Being+Outraged+Over+Anti-Semitism+Charges&shortener=bitly", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/embed.js?id=5326402898001&w=640&h=360", "https://twitter.com/IanHanchett", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F16%2Freporter-who-asked-trump-anti-semitism-question-im-with-trump-being-outraged-over-anti-semitism-charges%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Reporter+Who+Asked+Trump+Anti-Semitism+Question%3A+I%E2%80%99m+%E2%80%98With%E2%80%99+Trump+Being+Outraged+Over+Anti-Semitism+Charges"], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:03:21.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
