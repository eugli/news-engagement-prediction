Officials found 45 pounds of meth and more than $16,000 in cash.\n“This conviction breaks a link in the deadly supply chain pushing poison into our community,” Assistant District Attorney Brendan Murphy said. “In Cobb County, drug users get the help they need, but drug traffickers go to prison. Period.”\nIn addition to her prison sentence, Garcia must pay a $1 million fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:50:19.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
