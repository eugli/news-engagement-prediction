Runners will experience five zones of non-stop choons and tunes â€“ rock, pop, old school, hip hop and dance music will fill your ears while you pound the tracks. In the lead-up to the run, participants can vote for their favourite songs to be played during the event itself. Also happening is a post-run festival, where runners can party the night away with live music, DJ sets, performances, fireworks display and more. Early bird registration ends February 28.
