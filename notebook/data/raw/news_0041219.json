Sadly, Beatty as writer and director has chosen to make Hughes a supporting role, teasing a much deeper portrait.. – Peter Travers, Rolling Stone, Nov 25, 2016 \nFresh: This is a picture Beatty has wanted to make for years, and if the movie isn't the achievement it should be, it's at least entertaining in fits and starts. – Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine, Nov 25, 2016 \nRotten: There's a gulf between Hughes as we know him and Hughes as Beatty portrays him, and once you get past the sugarcoating, the rest of this film is more bitter than sweet. – Michael Nordine, Village Voice, Nov 22, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:49:00.971+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
