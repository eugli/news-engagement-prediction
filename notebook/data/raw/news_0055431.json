Key points: RET compliance rate falls from 99pc to 94 pc in 2016 15 electricity retailers failed to surrender correct number of renewable energy certificates Eight retailers failed to surrender a single certificate, copping $8m in penalties \nThe Clean Energy Regulator (CER), which administers the RET, has released data showing the compliance rate for the scheme has fallen from more than 99 per cent in previous years to 94 per cent in 2016. \nAccording to the data, 15 retailers incurred so-called shortfall penalties for failing to surrender the correct number of renewable energy certificates but ERM's was by far the highest at $123.5 million, followed by Alinta Energy, which paid $7.9 million. \nEight of those retailers, including QEnergy Limited and Next Business Energy, completely failed to meet their obligations, not surrendering a single certificate, and incurred more than $8 million in penalties combined. \nCER chairwoman Chloe Munroe said the fall in the compliance rate did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the scheme but said it was \"disappointing\" some retailers had chosen to pay the shortfall penalty. \nShe remained hopeful the retailers would, \"demonstrate their commitment to the RET\" and make up for the shortfall by sourcing more renewable energy than required in future. \n\"It is possible for entities to make good on their position by surrendering the missing number of certificates at a later date,\" she said.

(ABC News: Khama Reid) \nThe RET is a mandated target to ensure 23.5 per cent of Australia's energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. \nUnder the scheme, electricity retailers are required by law to purchase a certain number of renewable energy certificates from power stations each year and surrender them to the CER. If they don't, they must pay a penalty of $65 for each certificate they do not surrender. \nLast year, the price of certificates surged to about $90 — up from $35 in 2015 — prompting the decision by some retailers to pay the shortfall penalty rather than meet their obligation under the scheme. \nThe CER previously vowed to \"fully investigate\" those companies, accusing them of undermining the RET, however it conceded the practice was legal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:08:55.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
