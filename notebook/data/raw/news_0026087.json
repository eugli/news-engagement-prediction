Complete Winners List The full rundown of who won what on Music's Biggest Night \nAfter Daft Punk emerged from a foggy cave entrance on a stage covered with fake ice formations – with their capes, the French duo looked like Darth Vader impersonators – the Weeknd launched into the vintage disco groove of \"I Feel It Coming.\" He kept his onstage movements to a minimum, relying mainly on hand gestures. Daft Punk stood behind synths that were lit soft purple, and the Weeknd ended the performance standing in between them, with one hand outstretched to the audience. The duo incorporated \"Starboy,\" their other production for Weeknd, into the performance. \n\"I Feel It Coming\" is one of two collaborations between Daft Punk and the Weeknd that appeared on Starboy . These collaborations served to bookend the record: the title track kicks off the album, while \"I Feel It Coming\" brings the LP to a close. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal , the Weeknd described Daft Punk's approach to recording as \"very cinematic.\"\"They can get technical,\" he said, \"but it was interesting how they visualize making music.\" \nDaft Punk have won six Grammys, most of which were won in 2014 after the release of Random Access Memories , which included the mega-hit \"Get Lucky.\" The Weeknd also has a pair of awards from last year's ceremony.
