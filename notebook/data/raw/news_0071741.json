Smyth was at Dunphy's Mitchells Brook home to speak with him about tweets he wrote criticizing provincial politicians.\nSmyth, who was then a member of the premier's protective services unit, has testified that he fired his pistol in self defence after Dunphy pointed a rifle at him.\nConst. Joe Smyth testifying at the Dunphy Inquiry in St. John's. (Ted Dillon/CBC)\nTimeline errors The RCMP's timeline says Smyth tried to phone Dunphy's friend Colin Dinn before going to Dunphy's home.\nWe now know from previous testimony at the inquiry, that those calls were made to Dunphy's phone, not Dinn's, calls that didn't go through because of poor cell service.\nThe second timeline error is that police said the calls were made after Smyth visited Dunphy's brother and sister-in-law, Dick and Debbie Dunphy.\n'We can't rely on timeline account of when Smyth drew his gun.' - Kate O'Brien We now know those calls were made before that visit and a lawyer for the inquiry says that changes other parts of the timeline, including what happened inside Dunphy's home.\nWhile there is a time-stamped record of when Smyth called the RNC communications centre to report the shooting, Kate O'Brien said other times may not be reliable.\n\"It means the time between shooting and calling RCMP, (13 minutes and 15 seconds), we can no longer rely on that,\" said O'Brien. \"Because we can't rely on timeline account of when Smyth drew his gun.\"\nKate O'Brien is one of two lawyers acting as co-counsel for the Dunphy Inquiry. (CBC)\nThese times will likely be significant when lawyers for Smyth and Meghan Dunphy give their final summations to the inquiry.\nAny arguments suggesting evidence was tampered with or denying that happened will likely make references to the timeline of events on the day of the shooting.\nRCMP criminal analyst Wanda Richards created the timeline in the police report, using information given to her by other officers.\nTestifying at the inquiry on Thursday, she agreed there are errors in the timeline. She said that she has not been asked to revise the times.\nPolice taught to keep shooting until threat gone, RNC trainer tells Don Dunphy inquiry Follow along with the inquiry i n our live blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:10:26.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
