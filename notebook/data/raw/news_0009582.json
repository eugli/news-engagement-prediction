He is flanked by Matthew Thomas Madams and Tyrone Peter Madams, who were also sentenced to jail terms for their roles in the killing. \n﻿ A man convicted of murdering the founder of a Black Power chapter has been given a rare reprieve by not being sentenced to life imprisonment. \nSending Kevin Roy Madams to life would be manifestly unjust, Justice Jillian Mallon told the High Court in Whanganui on Friday. \nInstead, he was sentenced to nine years and 10 months' jail for the murder of Whanganui Black Power president Craig Rippon. David Unwin/Fairfax NZ \nTyrone William Madams pleaded guilty to Craig Rippon's murder. \nThree other family members - Tyrone Peter Madams, Matthew Thomas Madams and a youth who has name suppression - were sentenced for Rippon's manslaughter \nREAD MORE: \n﻿ Matthews Madams was sentenced to two years and four months, Tyrone Madams five years and 10 months, and the youth two years and seven months. Supplied \nCraig Rippon died after being assaulted at his Whanganui home in November 2015. \nTyrone Madams' son Tyrone William Madams pleaded guilty to murder before trial, and was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 12 years, while another youth was discharged during the trial. \nIt is accepted the discharged youth, who also has name suppression, was involved in the attack on Rippon's home on November 8, 2015. \nHowever, police were unable to prove he knew what he was doing at the time was wrong. \nKILLED OVER A PUPPY Ad Feedback \nThe judge said the spark that started events leading to Rippon's death was the return of a puppy to its owner. \nThe two youths, who are part of the wider Madams family, found the puppy, but Rippon gave it back to its owner. \nTyrone Peter and Kevin Madams became angry when they learned what had happened, wrongly believing Rippon got a reward. \nThey, the youths and Matthew Madams went to Rippon's house. An argument on the front lawn led to Tyrone Peter Madams being pushed over, cutting his eye and losing consciousness. \nThe Madams clan retreated, picking up Tyrone William Madams before returning to Rippon's. \nThe youths were wearing Black Power clothing. The youth who pleaded guilty to manslaughter would later tell a pre-sentence report writer he wanted to see what it was like to be in a gang. \nWhile the youths smashed windows and banged on a fence, Tyrone Williams Madams smashed his way into the sunporch. \nRippon, seeing what was happening, left via his back door and walked up the driveway, grabbing a spade as he went. \nThe youth who pleaded guilty hit Rippon, while Tyrone William Madams carried out a prolonged attack, striking Rippon multiple times to the head. \nKevin and Tyrone Peter Madams made their way onto the property after the assault started, while Matthew Madams stayed by the car. \nThe judge said Tyrone William Madams was the principal offender, striking the lethal blows, while all the others were involved as a party. \nWHY NOT LIFE? \nConvicted murderers must be sentenced to life imprisonment unless a judge decides doing so would be manifestly unjust. \nIt is very rare for a judge to use that discretion, with Stuff only finding one other case. \nThe judge said the difference in culpability between Tyrone Peter and Kevin Madams was the swaying factor. \nTyrone Peter Madams was the chief instigator of events, especially when deciding to return to Rippon's. \nThe disparity between a life sentence for Kevin Madams and what Tyrone Peter Madams got would be too great, she said. \nKevin Madams offered no violence, was not part of the first wave to enter Rippon's property, and did not intend for anyone to die.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T09:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:42:20.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
