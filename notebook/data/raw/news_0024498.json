He described the backlash as “the British equivalent of the deplorables” – the term used by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to describe half of Donald Trump’s supporters \nLord King said the “striking” difference between voting patterns in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the UK in the June vote highlighted a stark divide between the capital and the majority of English regions in the debate. Lord King was the Governor of the Bank of England for a decade until 2013 Credit: ANDY RAIN/EPA \n“That gap between London and the rest of the country was something that I, living outside, noticed but all my friends in London didn’t really appreciate,” he told an audience at the London School of Economics last night. \n“I [was] told, but if you even contemplate voting for Brexit, you must be either ignorant, uneducated, stupid or racist. [My] response was: I’m none of those, and I resent being described in those terms. \n“It was the British equivalent of the deplorables . And I think the reaction against it did play some role [in the Brexit vote].” \nL ord King, who retired from the Bank of England in 2013 after a decade as governor, has said the vote to leave the EU represents “real opportunities” for economic reform and has also called for a hard Brexit where the UK leaves the single market of goods and services. Theresa May, the prime minister said last month that the UK “cannot possibly” remain in the single market. \nLord King has also signalled that the country would be better off outside the customs union. \nHe said the Brexit vote and the election of Mr Trump as US president “raised questions” over whether “the [political] parties we have at present – in the US or the UK – actually have lost touch”. \nHe added: “Why they were created in the first place no longer seems relevant, and it’s more difficult to see what each party stands for, hence the rise of people who could represent one party or another but see themselves as the individual who can save the country.” Watch | Government wins backing to trigger Article 50 by 494 to 122 00:42 \nL ord King said he believed pressure for the EU referendum stemmed from an existing political party system that “does not give people a chance to vote on issues they really care about”. The main parties’ failure to address public concern about aspects of EU membership saw “demands for a referendum grow and grow” and led to the rise of Ukip, which received 3.9 million votes in the 2015 general election, he added. \n“Where you’ve seen that in the UK is exactly on those issues where parties in a sense suppressed the debate … And in the end it may well have been inevitable either that there was a referendum or that one of the parties would have had to represent in a very clear way their position on the EU and give people a chance to vote on it.” \nHe described the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader by the party’s members amid a backlash by his own MPs as “odd”. \n“I think this could be a sign of the future – that people become very nervous about the idea that so-called direct democracy may not be the best way of giving the country a choice between both parties and leaders. So rather than turn it into a personality contest [there could be attempts] to try to give greater weight to the professional party politicians in helping to choose a leader.” Follow Telegraph Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:02:58.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
