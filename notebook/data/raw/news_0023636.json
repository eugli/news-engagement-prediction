Photo: Lea Suzuki, The Chronicle Three Dash players called into USWNT SheBelieves Cup training camp 1 / 3 Back to Gallery \nThree Dash players, including two-time reigning FIFA Women's Player of the Year Carli Lloyd, are on the USWNT roster for next month's SheBelieves Cup, which will pit four of the world's top five teams against one another. \nLloyd will be joined by midfielder Morgan Brian and rookie goalkeeper Jane Campbell. Together they will be part of the 25-player training camp roster that will represent the United States in matches against Germany, England and France. \nAt the conclusion of camp, head coach Jill Ellis will name a 23-player roster for the tournament. \n\"January gave us a chance to see some new faces in with the veterans, and get some quality time on the training field,\" Ellis said. \"A player's performance in that camp and positional depth guided our selection for this pre-camp, and from here we will select our SheBelieves Cup roster. There will be no better test than opening against Germany, so we will need to have a laser focus as soon as we land in Orlando. As our players have not yet returned to their clubs, they have been training in their independent environments, so playing as much 11v11 situations will again be critical during these few days.\" \nThe round-robin tournament will be played on March 1, 4 and 7 as three doubleheaders in the same stadiums. It is the most prestigious tournament the USWNT will play this year. It won the title in last year's inaugural edition. \nThe USWNT will face Germany at Talon Energy Stadium in Chester, Pa., on March 1. On March 4, the USWNT will face England at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J. The finale will be on March 7 against France at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. \nLloyd and Brian are regulars with the USWNT and both played on the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup championship team. Lloyd, who in January was named the world player of the year for the second year in a row, has 232 caps and 96 goals. Brian has six goals in 63 appearances. \nCampbell, a Stanford product, has never appeared in a game for the USWNT but is viewed as one of the country's up-and-coming goalkeepers. Dash coach Randy Waldrum already had two goalkeepers on his roster but picked her in the second round of January's NWSL Draft because he said her potential is too good to pass up.
