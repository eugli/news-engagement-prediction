And what should you really care about? \nEach week, we'll be counting down the five most important things in our world right now. The new gadgets that we're excited about - and that you should be excited about too. The games and apps we're desperate to play - and that we want you to enjoy too. The best phones and tablets and cameras and laptops and smartwatches and all the rest that we've reviewed that week - and that you should go out and buy. \nThink of it as a condensed version of the whole site. But don't forget to read the rest of it too, eh? 5) Sky Q finally has a 4K rival - sort of \nWe really like Sky Q, but not everyone wants it and some can't get it at all. For those people the idea of Virgin finally launching a 4K set-top box is pretty exciting. \nIt's a bit of a shame, then, that the reality is rather disappointing, largely because there's a real lack of actual 4K content to watch with it. \nOn the other hand, the TV V6 offers a much, much slicker user experience than the Tivo box it replaces, can record oodles of things at once and has oodles of space to store it, and offers a sweet multi-room option. \nShould you buy it? Check out our full review to find out.

Maybe it’s the way they scuttle across the floors and walls, just in the corner of your eye, or the freakish way they can morph into any everyday object, camouflaging themselves as a desk lamp, coffee cup or office chair. \nOr, probably, it’s how they lunge for you when you get too close, trying to get intimately entwined with your oesophagus. Yep, Prey is scary - but would you expect any less from the spiritual successor to legendary sci-fi chiller System Shock , as told by Dishonored developer Arkane Studios? \nWe got to play the first hour at a preview event this week, and we’re still nervous when someone asks us to make the tea rounds. Read more hands-on with Prey 3) Your whole house can be a remote control \nSo far, most of us have traded a 'bundle of remotes' problem for a 'bundle of apps' problem. Sure, hubs such as Apple HomeKit and SmartThings are slowly weaving our home tech together, but none of them let you turn your lounge table into a controller for your Sonos speaker. \nThat's why we're excited about 'virtual remote' system Hayo. This Echo-like cylinder scans your room, then lets you place invisible controls for Nest thermostats or Philips Hue lights anywhere within it thanks to an augmented reality app. \nNot that it really matters how Hayo works – all that matters is that you'll be able to impress guests by tapping a table to start music, or turning on lights by waving your arms in the air. Even if that does mean accidentally clotheslining your aunt in the process. Read more Hayo turns your house into a remote control 2) HTC's created a glassterpiece \nWhat’s this - the company that kicked off the trend for metal phones turning its back on metal? HTC’s latest goes for glass instead - and not just any old glass. The U Ultra is supposed to look like liquid flowing over your phone, and damn pretty it is too. \nIt’s great to see a phone maker try something different, instead of trot out yet another all-metal iPhone-alike, and HTC hasn’t stopped there - the U Ultra also gets a funky second screen to handle all of your notifications, while being kind to your battery. \nIt’s a refreshing change of pace from the rest of the smartphone world, and we love it - even if it isn’t quite perfect. Read more HTC U Ultra review 1) The world has gone nostalgia nuts \nNo, you’re not reading an entry from the year 2000: Nokia’s most famous phone is back - and it’s as indestructible as ever. \nAt least, we think it’s back. There’s been no official word, yet, but it’s probably enough that reliable leaker Even Blass has suggested that HMD - Nokia’s new owners - plans to relaunch the beloved dumb-phone at MWC in a couple of weeks. \nThat news was certainly enough to set the internet ablaze with both nostalgia and bewilderment, and with good reason: a rebooted 3310 will surely bring back all the best bits of throwback mobiles. Think weeks of battery life, unbreakable build quality and, of course, Snake . \nWhether it’ll sell is a different matter, not least given the fact that you can scoop up an original online for about a fiver. Our man Craig Grannell certainly isn't convinced . \nStill, who’d have thought that in 2017 the tech world would be as hyped about the launch of a 3310 as the next LG smartphone, eh?
