Until now, it was not known how over-eating impacts on the system,\" Dr Peter Alexander, from the university's School of GeoSciences and Scotland's Rural College, said. \n\"Not only is it harmful to health, we found that overeating is bad for the environment and impairs food security.\" \nAlmost half of harvested crops — or 2.1 billion tonnes — are lost through over-consumption, consumer waste and inefficiencies in production processes, researchers say. How to eat more sustainably Eat fewer animal products Reduce food waste Don't exceed your nutritional needs \nA Rabobank report in September said Australians wasted $10 billion in food every year , with the national food waste figure increasing on the previous three years. \nLivestock production is the least efficient process, with losses of 78 per cent, or 840 million tonnes, the University of Edinburgh team found. \nSome 1.08 billion tonnes of harvested crops are used to produce 240 million tonnes of edible animal products including meat, milk and eggs. \nThis stage alone accounts for 40 per cent of all losses of harvested crops, researchers say. \nIncreased demand for some foods, particularly meat and dairy products, would decrease the efficiency of the food system and could make it difficult to feed the world's expanding population in sustainable ways, researchers said. \nMeeting this demand could cause environmental harm by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, depleting water supplies and causing loss of biodiversity. \nEncouraging people to eat fewer animal products, reduce waste and not exceed their nutritional needs could help to reverse these trends, the team said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:59:11.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
