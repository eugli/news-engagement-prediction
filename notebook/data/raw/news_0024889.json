The footage helped spark a World Anti-Doping Agency investigation into Russia, and led to Savinova's blood samples being re-examined. \nSavinova has not raced competitively since 2013. She had been preparing for a comeback when she was filmed by Stepanova and then suspended during the investigation. \nFollowing further evidence of widespread drug use, the Russian track team was suspended from all international competitions in November 2015 and missed last year's Olympics. \nIf the International Olympic Committee decides to reallocate the medals from the 2012 final, Semenya will add that gold medal to the one she won last year in Rio de Janeiro. \nThe original bronze medalist in the 2012 Olympic final, Ekaterina Poistogova of Russia, is also under investigation for doping. If she is banned, Pamela Jelimo of Kenya would be in line for silver, with bronze for Alysia Montano of the United States. Another Russian who originally finished sixth, Elena Arzahkova, was retrospectively disqualified in 2013 over blood doping. \nSemenya could also become a two-time world champion by inheriting Savinova's gold medal from 2011. Yvonne Hak of the Netherlands is in line for the 2010 European title, though Savinova keeps the 2010 world indoor title she won ahead of Britain's Jenny Meadows. \nThe Russian is also obliged to return at least $156,000 in prize money from various competitions where she's now considered disqualified. \nThe WADA commission which investigated Russian track and field had originally recommended a lifetime ban for Savinova. \nShe can appeal the CAS ruling within 45 days. \nIn the footage filmed by Stepanova, Savinova said doping was the only way to succeed in Russian sport. \n\"What should we do? How should it go differently? That is our system and in Russia that only works only with pharma,\" she said, according to a transcript produced by WADA. \n\"Oxandrolone is very quickly out of my body out again. It takes less than 20 days.\" \nSavinova also said that her husband, former runner Alexei Farnosov, had used \"contacts\" at a drug-testing laboratory to help cover up her doping. The Moscow drug-testing laboratory was later shut down and its director testified he had covered up hundreds of failed tests by top Russian athletes. \nTwo top coaches who worked with Savinova, Alexei Melnikov and Vladimir Kazarin, have also faced punishment. Melnikov was banned for life by the IAAF last year, while Kazarin is suspended awaiting the results of an investigation, though he's been accused of breaking that suspension by continuing to coach Russian runners.
