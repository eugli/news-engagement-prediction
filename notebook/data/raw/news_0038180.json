Actor Paul Butcher , best known for playing Jamie Lynn Spears 's younger brother on Zoey 101 , has covered plenty of songs by the likes of Zayn , Shawn Mendes , and Justin Bieber , but now he's starting 2017 off with an original called \"Blood.\" \nThe song urges everyone to join together as one, instead of trying so hard to work against each other. Butcher recorded the track with Taylor Hill . The two both star in the poignant, black-and-white music video, which is inter-spliced with protest footage. \n\"What pushed me to make this powerful song was my belief that it's an artist's duty to create art that reflects the times and can ultimately make a difference,\" Butcher told MTV News. \"I first started working on this song while I was collaborating with Taylor Hill and Nick Cooper on music, at the Vocal Corner Store. The song really touched me and I hoped by putting it out it would get people to want to come from a place of love and unity, as well as provoke some thought on how we can all work together peacefully.\" \nThe 23-year-old admitted he's working on more original music, describing it as \"more Pop/R&B mainstream.\" However, this doesn't mean Butcher will stop making cover songs. His covers of \" Love Yourself \" and \" Little Things ,\" amongst others, won't be going away anytime soon, but he does want fans to know his originals are designed to show off his own creative prowess. \n\"Each song I have done and am currently working on has a story or meaning behind them,\" he said. \"Whether it is to make people dance, smile, cry, or to heal broken hearts, I would like true emotion to be released.\" Based on the emotionally affecting imagery and lyrics in \"Blood,\" it looks like he's well on his way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:00:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
