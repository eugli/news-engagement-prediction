PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 GETTY EU migration costs the UK £30bn a year, claims study \nThat large companies have benefited from our open borders while ordinary people have suffered hardly comes as a revelation but we can be grateful to think tank Global Britain for calculating this important statistic. \nFor years this newspaper has been warning of the dangers of unfettered immigration.
