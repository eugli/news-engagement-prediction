Maybe he’s starting to be a legend with the goals he’s scoring and the way he behaves. \n“He is so professional. He has the prefect profile to be a legend here. He has his character.

He deserves it. He is very professional. A top man and I’m happy. It’s nothing new for me. I’ve said many times before that for me Harry is one of the best strikers in the world.” \nKane also set up Dele Alli for Tottenham’s fourth, all before half time. It moves the north Londoners above Manchester City into second, ten points behind runaway leaders Chelsea.

He is always involved at the sharp end. \n“There’s great movement around him and that causes consternation. He benefits from that. He’s in a good team and he’s a good player and when it all clicks they’re very difficult to stop.” \nThe defeat was the second in six games for the Potters. Hughes believes his players showed their title-challenging hosts too much respect.

We talked about a bright start but it didn’t materialise. We were a little bit too passive. \n“We allowed good players time to get shots off. Every one of the goals was poor from our point view. We were slightly better second half, but that was more to do with Spurs taking their foot off the gas. \n“At times a little bit awe-struck maybe. We gave them too much respect. As a consequence we were picked off.” poll loading Will Harry Kane be Tottenham's all-time scorer? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:29.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
