When the researchers pump water into the hydrogel robots, the structures quickly inflate in orientations that enable the bots to curl up or stretch out. \nThe team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US fashioned several hydrogel robots, including a finlike structure that flaps back and forth, an articulated appendage that makes kicking motions, and a soft, hand-shaped robot that can squeeze and relax. \nAs the robots are both powered by and made almost entirely of water, they have similar visual and acoustic properties to water, researchers said. \nThey propose that these robots, if designed for underwater applications, may be virtually invisible. \nThe group, led by Xuanhe Zhao, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, and graduate student Hyunwoo Yuk, is currently looking to adapt hydrogel robots for medical applications. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Saturday, February 4, 2017 - 20:33 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T16:33:52.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
