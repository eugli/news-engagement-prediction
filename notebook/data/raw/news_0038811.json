Key points: Homeland Security Secretary says the new proposal will be a more streamlined version of the first travel ban order He promised a \"phase-in\" period to \"make sure that people on the other end don't get on airplanes\" Donald Trump's original order sparked chaos at airports and protests around the country \nPresident Donald Trump's initial attempt to clamp down on immigration from predominantly Muslim counties and on refugees stalled amid mass protests at airports across the US as well as legal challenges. \n\"The President is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version of the first [order],\" Mr Kelly announced at a Munich security conference. \n\"And I will have opportunity to work [on] a rollout plan, in particular to make sure that there's no one in a sense caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports\" \nAsked whether green card residency permit holders would be allowed in, Mr Kelly said: \"It's a good assumption and, as far as the visas go ... if they're in motion from some distant land to the United States, when they arrive they will be allowed in.\" \nHe promised \"a short phase-in period to make sure that people on the other end don't get on airplanes\". \n\"But if they're on an airplane and inbound, they'll be allowed to enter the country.\" \nMr Trump's original order, which he said was meant to head off attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering for 90 days. \nIt also excluded all refugees for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. \nThe abrupt implementation of the order last month plunged the immigration system into chaos, sparking a wave of criticism from the countries affected, and from Western allies and some of America's leading corporations, especially technology firms. \nReuters First posted February 19, 2017 09:25:16 Immigration order", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:42:46.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
