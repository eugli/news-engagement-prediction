Tonight it's Young Thug who is on the receiving end of the gift train. \nTaking to Instagram, Thugger posted a video of his new diamond-studded YSL chain with the caption, \"Thanks @champagnepapi #MORELIFE.\" \nThe two rappers are currently touring together on Drake's Boy Meets World Tour. \nCheck out Young Thug's IG video below, and let us know your thoughts in the comments.
