Related: WATCH: Giants' Eli Manning masterfully trolls Skip Bayless \nBoth athletes are top talents in their respective sports and have developed a friendship over the years. Being in New York, Beckham Jr.’s spotlight is amplified and James knows a thing or two about being at the center of the media. \nAs someone who currently is and has been where Beckham Jr. is in terms of prominence, James offers to help his friend any way he can. \n“I just try to be a guidance to him and give him words of advice when he needs it and when he wants it,” James told Dan Duggan of NJ Advance Media on Saturday . “He can reach out to me any time no matter what time or what the subject is and I just try to give him a piece of my knowledge. It’s up to him however he wants to take it.” \nJames, 32, is a bit older than Beckham Jr., 24, but the former has been in the spotlight since the Cavaliers drafted him first overall in the 2003 NBA Draft. Whether good or bad, James is one of the most, if not the most, talked about player in the NBA. \nThe two stars got together in July 2016 to train together after James beat the Golden State Warriors in the Finals to earn his third championship and have kept in touch.

That’s the only thing I can worry about and should focus on.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:01:43.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
