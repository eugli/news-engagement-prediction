But the man was an undercover government informant.\nJalloh also arranged through the informant to send a $500 (Â£400) donation to the group.\nDuring the trial, Jalloh's lawyers described his experience with IS \"a flirtation\" that stemmed from a difficult childhood in war-torn Sierra Leone.\n\"I feel like a complete idiot for accepting such a superficial and dishonest interpretation of Islam,\" Jalloh wrote in a letter to the court.\nIn a separate case in New York, a 21-year-old former college student pleaded guilty to aiding the same terror group.\nMunther Omar Saleh had planned to attack New York City using a pressure cooker bomb, prosecutors alleged, and had attacked a law enforcement officer with a knife.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/66239000/gif/_66239292_line2.gif", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1357A/production/_94262297_mediaitem94262296.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/66239000/gif/_66239292_line2.gif"], "published": "2017-02-11T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:43:56.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
