(Photo: Robert_Scheer_IndyStar) Story Highlights Cavaliers at Pacers, 7 p.m. Wednesday, Fox Sports Indiana \nINDIANAPOLIS — The Indiana Pacers, throughout their modest winning streak, have stressed they need no validation for their improvement. Wins, no matter if they come over inferior opponents or quality teams, were simply welcome after half a season of inconsistent play. \nBut make no mistake, five of the Pacers’ previous six victories were over teams with losing records. Monday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, however, served as another chance for the Pacers to prove themselves as growing contenders in the Eastern Conference. \nThe Pacers were not perfect, yet their determination was enough for them to survive the offensive assault from Russell Westbrook for a tense 93-90 victory at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The win, one of the Pacers’ most impressive of the season, extended their streak to a season-high seven games. \n• BOX SCORE : Pacers 93, Thunder 90 \nOn the game’s final possession, Westbrook had two chances with 7.6 seconds left to force overtime with 3-pointers. Both shots bounced off the rim. \nPaul George did his best to match Westbrook’s intensity in the fourth quarter while guarding the Thunder superstar. George was also good enough on offense. He made a turnaround jumper in the final minute for the game’s final basket. \nGeorge led the Pacers with 21 points and eight rebounds. Jeff Teague was also instrumental with 17 points. \nNeither team shot well, yet the Pacers provided plenty of resistance to Westbrook. The Pacers were fine with Westbrook leading the Thunder with 27 points because they made him take 27 shots. Westbrook led all players with an impressive 18 rebounds and recorded nine assists, falling one short of a triple-double. \nIndiana (29-22) didn’t begin well. \nOn certain possessions, the Pacers made finding an open shot look painful. The Thunder swarmed the Pacers’ pick-and-roll plays. They crowded the Pacers on the perimeter, too. And unlike the previous meeting this season, the Thunder sealed off the paint. Facebook Posted!
