Scott, who is now boss of Party Central Entertainments Ltd and has ambitions to run his own zoo, told The Mirror : 'We've learnt all about how to budget and how to do our finances. And now we've got our own business and it's getting better and better. We do christenings, car shows, birthday parties. But now the pair, from Kirkby, Liverpool, have filled their home with exotic pets and run an animal events business The couple's son clutching bundles of banknotes after the cash was delivered to the family Scott and wife Leanne, 26, look after a 12-foot Burmese python (pictured), five foot-long iguanas, snakes, spiders, millipedes, snails, a skink and an owl Scott, who is now boss of Party Central Entertainments Ltd, said: 'We've learnt all about how to budget and how to do our finances' 'We took three deposits yesterday. We've got bookings right up to October. I prefer working for myself rather than being on benefits. Life used to just go by day by day. It was time to start doing stuff for ourselves.' The couple had been on benefits for six years after Scott gave up his job as an electrician to care full-time for their son Robert who suffers from serious behavioural problems and was being tested for autism. Speaking to the MailOnline last year, he said more families should have the chance to escape a life on benefits by being given enough money to make an investment, rather than just day-to-day spending. The couple had been on benefits for six years after Scott gave up his job as an electrician to care full-time for their son Robert who suffers from serious behavioural problems and is being tested for autism But he also suggested that the experiment would not be appropriate for all benefits claimants, because some cannot be trusted to spend the cash wisely. Scott said: 'I was hoping to set up my own business and get out of being a carer.' After they were chosen to appear on The Big Benefits Handout they had to quit benefits in exchange for being given a suitcase with £26,000 in cash - the maximum amount one family can claim in benefits in a year. The documentary is intended to mimic 'unconditional cash transfer' schemes which operate in some Third World countries In the opening scenes of the programme, they were pictured drinking champagne in celebration, and within a few days they had spent £6,000 on items needed to start their party business, including a Titanic-themed inflatable slide for £950 and a £460 raccoon. Describing his vision on the show, Mr Gavin said: 'The type of business I'm looking at doing is reptile shows, educational shows for schools and colleges - I'd also go to parties too. 'I could do with some giant millipedes, maybe some giant snails, giant Madagascan cockroaches, 12ft snakes, 6ft lizards and a nice iguana.' Many academics claim the cash handouts encourage recipients to take control of their own lives The documentary showed Mrs Gavin questioning her husband's purchase of the raccon, saying, 'I don't see how anyone's going to go, \"I know, let's invite a raccoon to my birthday party,\"' while he replies: 'They invite Peppa Pig.' But she has now laughed off the incident, saying: 'The only reason I had that reaction was that he didn't tell me he was buying it, he just told one of the producers, \"Oh, I've bought a raccoon,\" and I was like, \"WHAT?\"' The documentary is intended to mimic 'unconditional cash transfer' schemes which operate in some Third World countries, where poor people are simply given cash rather than food handouts or other benefits. Many academics claim the cash handouts encourage recipients to take control of their own lives - but others worry that they encourage some claimants to spend irresponsibly. The filmmakers have rejected claims that the show is a form of 'poverty porn', insisting that it is a sensitive examination of the best way to help the jobless off benefits and back into work. The Great British Benefits Handout Changed My Life airs tonight at 9 pm on Channel 5 Not everyone was convinced, however, with some questioning whether the family really made any money Read more: Share or comment on this article 648", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:37:26.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
