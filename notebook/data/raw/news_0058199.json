If he did not, his blood sugar could dip to dangerously low levels.\nIn a Facebook post, the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Department said that Howard was seen eating twice while he was at the jail and he was not deprived of food.\n“The truth is that we don't know why 23-year-old Christopher Howard suffered a medical emergency less than eight hours after he arrived at our jail. No one knows yet,” the post says. “We do know, however, that our staff worked very diligently to save his life.”\nLike Gwinnett County News on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter and Instagram", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/gwinnettnewsnow/?fref=nf", "http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/family-death-of-jail-inmate-may-have-been-avoided-with/article_d75d868c-4b28-517e-afd4-f3baee4da75d.html", "https://www.instagram.com/gwinnettnewsnow/", "http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/gainesvilletimes/obituary.aspx?n=christopher-howard&pid=184182507&", "https://twitter.com/GwinnettNewsNow"], "published": "2017-02-25T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:52:02.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
