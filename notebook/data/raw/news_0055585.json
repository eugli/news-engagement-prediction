Credit: Suffolk Police The mother of missing airman Corrie McKeague says she is \"greatly\" concerned over delays to search a landfill site.\nSuffolk Police are due to start going through a landfill site in Milton in Cambridgeshire.\nCCTV shows a waste lorry made a collection in an area of Bury St Edmunds known as the horseshoe shortly after the last confirmed sighting of Corrie.\nIt has been something that has concerned me greatly from the start, because I did always want it searched.\n– Nicola Urquhart, Corrie's mother However, the work at the landfill site has been delayed because 8,000 tonnes of bulk material has to be removed first to allow safe access to where the search needs to take place.\nNicola Urquhart, Corrie's mother, said: \"It has been something that has concerned me greatly from the start, because I did always want it searched.\n\"But hindsight is a wonderful thing. Perhaps it could have been done in the fourth week, but it's getting done now, that's what matters.\n\"Let's just hope that we do get some kind of positive bit of news from it.\"\nDetective Superintendent Katie Elliott from Suffolk Police said: \"This is a considerable task and we need to ensure everything is in place before officers begin the process of going through the waste in the landfill.\n\"We have been liaising with Corrie’s family around the timescales involved and, while we can’t confirm a start date, this preliminary work will be completed as quickly as possible, so the full scale search can take place.\"\nA bin lorry made a collection shortly after the last sighting of Corrie McKeague.
