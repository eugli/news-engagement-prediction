But the company instead selected a less valuable bid by FCS Acquisition, which like Family Christian is owned by the nonprofit Family Christian Resource Centers Inc.\nThe Grand Rapids, Michigan-based retailer was eventually sold for $55 million to FCS Acquisition.\n(Reporting by Jim Christie in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:19:27.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
