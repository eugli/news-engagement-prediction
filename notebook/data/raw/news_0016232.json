PA:Press Association Former Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman was found guilty of murdering the Afghani soldier PA:Press Association 5 Claire Blackman, the wife of Alexander Blackman, arrived at the High Court for the appeal on Tuesday morning \nJonathan Goldberg opened the new appeal against the Royal Marine’s sentencing, saying the conditions that those within the Plymouth-based 42 Commando faced in the Helmand province were “austere” and a “breeding ground” for mental health problems. \nHe said: “Only those who have been on the front line can know what it is really like.” \nHe added that Blackman had almost been killed by a grenade himself, while also losing a close friend, saying: “Mr Blackman’s nature is to be very reserved. He is a sort of John Wayne character.” PA:Press Association Supporters gathered outside the court on Tuesday morning before the appeal began Supporter of 'Marine A' Alexander Blackman at High Court for bail hearing \nThe court heard that the Taliban were \"ruthless and cunning\", with shooting incidents often happening on a daily basis. \nThe QC argued that Blackman had \"endured\" the loss of a young company officer \"with whom he had been on very close terms\" and had mentored, with the toll that the marine experienced at the heart of the appeal. \nThe opening case comes after the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, said his legal team carried out \"inadequate\" preparations for his 2013 court martial. \nThe CCRC announced it had concluded that a number of new issues, including fresh evidence relating to Blackman's mental state, ''raise a real possibility'' that the Court Martial Appeal Court ''will now quash Mr Blackman's murder conviction''. \nOnly those who have been on the front line can know what it is really like Jonathan Goldberg QC \nThe most recent conviction challenge is being heard by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir Brian Leveson, Lady Justice Hallett, Mr Justice Openshaw and Mr Justice Sweeney, with the proceedings expected to last three days. \nHis wife Claire and dozens of supporters attended the first day of the appeal, with jailed Blackman watching the proceedings via videolink from prison. \nBlackman was previously convicted in November 2013 by a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 10 years. \nHis minimum term was reduced to eight years during an appeal in May 2014, with it found he was suffering from combat stress disorder at the time of the 2011 shooting. \nBlackman applied for bail in December 2016, pending the appeal, but the move was rejected by two judges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:59:59.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
