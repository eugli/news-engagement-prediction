Trump indicated that he has been a high achiever these first few weeks in the White House. \"In terms of achievement, I think I'd give myself an A. Because I think I've done great things -- I and my people, but I don't think we've explained it well enough to the American public,\" he said in an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends.\" \"I think I give myself an A in terms of what I've actually done,\" Trump added. But the President seemed to think he's just been an average messenger. Read More \"In terms of messaging, I would give myself a C or a C+,'\" he said. Trump also gave himself an A+ for \"effort.\" \"But results are more important (than effort),\" he added. A Quinnipiac University survey released last week found that American voters don't view how Trump is handling his job as favorably. The majority of American voters -- 55% -- disapprove of Trump's performance. Only 38% of American voters approve of Trump's job performance.
