"highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "The Best LA Openings of January 2017 There was much to Google in 2016, and a lot of the internet’s fascination pertained to the long and often bitter presidential election. Even in February, nearly two months after Donald Trump shocked the country on November 8, the election and all of its piss-soaked hysterics still have the nation frothing. Estately -- the real estate company that dabbles in great Internet data -- compiled this map, which shows the things all 50 states have Googled more than every other state since the election. Unsurprisingly, much of what you’ll see scattered across the country is completely insane, and kind of disheartening. But there are some glimmers of righteousness, like “ Gay dance party Mike Pence ” which the great state of Virginia wanted to know more about. “Martin Shkreli dog poop” was the winner in Illinois, after the notorious pharma-bro was pelted with canine feces at a university speaking engagement. Iowa was curious about “Russian prostitutes,” which makes sense in light of Maryland’s pet-topic, “ dossier on Trump. ” Vice President Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana might have kept it the realest though, as it’s citizens Googled “ Cheetos bronzer. ” That term may or may not have something to do with the skin-tone of a certain commander-in-chief.
