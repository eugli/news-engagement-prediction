(Picture: Rex) \nLove Actually is returning for a sequel and we couldn’t be more OVERJOYED. \nGranted, it’s only going to be 10 minutes long as it’s for a Red Nose Day comedy sketch, courtesy of director and all-round legend Richard Curtis, but still. \nThe plot will revisit the much-loved characters 14 years on and will give us a taste of what they’re up to in present day London. \nSo we felt it was high time to remind of ourselves and you lot of what the cast – from Hugh Grant to Martine McCutcheon, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley – looked like back then in 2003 at the London premiere in Leicester Square. The cast of Love Actually attended the UK premiere in London on November 16, 2003 (Picture: Getty Images) \nWe’ve delved into the picture archives and dug out some absolute crackers from the Love Actually premiere, held on November 16, 2003. \nAnd it’s fair to say fashions have, er, changed slightly. \nSo prepare yourselves for the throwback photos of ALL throwback photos as we look back on a time when Hugh Grant was the ultimate babe magnet… Hugh Grant, aged 43, and Martine McCutcheon, aged 27 (Picture: Getty Images) Martine McCutcheon and Hugh Grant during Love Actually (Picture: WireImage) (Picture: Getty Images) Hugh, Martine and Keira Knightley: (Picture: Getty Images) Hugh can’t keep his eyes off his female co-stars: (Picture: Getty Images) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:10:19.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
