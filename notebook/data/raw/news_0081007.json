We previously reported that Kyle Chandler will be playing her father, and now Variety says that Vera Farmiga will be playing her mother. We don’t know much about their roles beyond that, but Farmiga has battled supernatural forces in the Conjuring movies, so she may have some relevant experience to bring to Godzilla: King Of The Monsters . \nThe sequel is being directed by Krampus ’ Michael Dougherty, and the Variety story says that the only character from the first movie who is expected to return is Ken Watanabe’s Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. That plan could change, though, since the movie won’t come out until 2019. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:09:18.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
