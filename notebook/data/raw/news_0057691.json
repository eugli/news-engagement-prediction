The LG K10 smartphone will be manufactured in India at the company's Noida facility and will come pre-bundled with India-specific initiatives like 112 SOS panic button. \nThe LG K10 2017 is an amalgamation of perfect design and perfect defence, says LG. The phone was first announced in January at CES. The version coming to India will, however, be slightly different in that it would be wholly manufactured in the country and would also come with technology that makes more sense in the world's largest growing mobile economy.

It works by quickly pressing the power button three times in a row. \nIn terms of hardware specs, the K10 comes with a 5.3-inch 720p screen and an octa-core MediaTek MT6750 processor with 2GB of RAM under the hood. The phone comes with up to 32GB of internal memory which is further expandable. It sports a 13-megapixel camera on the rear and a 5-megapixel camera (supporting 120 degree wide-angle selfies) on the front. The Android Nougat powered LG K10 is further backed by a 2,800mAh battery which is also removable. \nThe K10 also gets a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, 4G LTE (VoLTE) and USB OTG out-of-the-box.
