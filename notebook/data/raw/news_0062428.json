However, there was was one beautiful moment that had everyone in tears: Chris Martin’s tribute to George Michael .\nMichael's Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, along with their backing singers Pepsi & Shirlie - Helen DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman - took to the stage beforehand to remember the singer.\nThe event marked the first time Ridgeley has publicly commented on Michael’s death, not including social media posts.\n\"On Christmas Day 2016, the greatest singer-songwriter of his generation, an icon of his era, and my beloved friend, George Michael, was lost,” he told the audience. \n\"A supernova in a firmament of shining stars had been extinguished, and it felt like the sky had fallen in. It started out ordinarily enough: In 1975, we were two boys that happened to share a mutual sense of humour, a love of life-affirming music, the records and artists it gave birth to, and a shared sense that we understood it.”\nGeorge Michael: a life in pictures 20 show all George Michael: a life in pictures 1/20 1982 Wham perform at the Hammersmith Odeon \nRex\n2/20 1983 George Micheal and Andrew Ridley perform in concert in June 1983\nRex Features\n3/20 1984 May 1984 Exclusive Photocall with Wham When Their Song 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-go' Hit Number One in the Charts at Bbc Tv Centre George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley \nRex Features\n4/20 1985 Ivor Novello Awards at the Grosvenor House Hotel, George Michael (songwriter of the Year) and Andrew Ridgeley\nRex Features\n5/20 1985 Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael in Tiananmen Square, during their WHAM! in China tour in 1985\nRex Features\n6/20 1986 rank Bruno Boxer 1986 George Michael And Frank Bruno.
