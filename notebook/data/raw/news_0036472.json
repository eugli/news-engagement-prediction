This is good news for Capcom, because the last time the publisher had the best-selling game of the month (in dollar sales) was March of 2009 with Resident Evil 5. In total, game software sales actually grew by about $39 million when compared to the same date a year ago.\nHowever, the industries sales actually fell by about four percent overall thanks to a decline in hardware from the previous year. This is likely due to the fact that the PS4 and Xbox One are over three years old at this point and many players have finally purchased the newest hardware. The PlayStation 4 was the best-selling hardware of January 2017 while the NES Classic Edition was the third best-selling console of the month.\nHereâ€™s the full report of the top selling physical sales of software for January 2017:\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Grand Theft Auto V Battlefield 1 NBA 2K17 Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue Madden NFL 17 Watch Dogs 2 Overwatch FIFA 17  \nOur Take \nIt's nice to see Resident Evil selling well as it's one of the best entries in the series in years. It's also interesting to see that Call of Duty is still selling well, even though Activision isn't happy with the sales . I'm also impressed that Overwatch remains on the top 10 even though its about eight months old at this point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:24:27.603+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
