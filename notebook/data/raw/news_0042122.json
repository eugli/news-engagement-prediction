sanctuaries across Afghan border: sources \nKARACHI: At least 15 terrorists were killed and scores wounded in an another targeted strike by the Pakistani forces across Afghan border areas on Sunday, reports sources in Afghanistan. \nThe Afghan sources informed that a high-value target is known for recruiting terrorists and training suicide bomber, Rehman Baba, was also gunned down, further adding that at least 12 terror sanctuaries, including a hideout and weapon depot camp of Jammat-ul-Ahrar`s commander, Wali, were also pounded by the forces. \nT. \nPakistani forces targeted terrorists based across the Pak-Afghan border, military sources said late Friday, following a week of deadly terrorist attacks in the country in which over 100 people were killed. \nThe strikes were conducted hours after Afghan embassy officials were summoned to the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where they were handed over a list of 76 terrorists orchestrating terrorist activities in Pakistan from Afghan soil. \nPakistan has repeatedly warned Afghan authorities to prevent the use of their soil for terror activities in Pakistan. \nIn Friday's meeting, it demanded the Afghan officials to take action against these terrorists or hand them over to it. \nThere has so far been no official confirmation regarding the developments from the Pakistani military or government, but informed sources told Geo News that the army targeted Jamaat-ul-Ahrar sanctuaries across the border of Khyber and Mohmand tribal agencies. \nThe camps were situated on the Afghan side of the porous border. \nThe army targeted four terrorist camps in Friday's strikes, besides destroying a training compound of Jamatul Ahrar, sources added. \nThere have been reports that several militants, including the deputy commander of Jamatul Ahrar Adil Bacha, were killed in the strikes. \nIt is pertinent to note here that Jamat-ul-Ahrar, which has safe havens in Afghanistan and operates with impunity there, had claimed responsibility for last week's terrorist attacks in Pakistan. \nOn Thursday, at least 88 people were martyred when a suicide bomber attacked the crowded Sufi shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan, injuring up to 343 others, according to DG Health Services Sindh. \nThe powerful blast took place inside the premises of the shrine as a dhammal was taking place. \nEarlier on Friday, Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa held a telephonic conversation with US General John Nicholson, Commander of Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in Afghanistan conveying his concerns over continued acts of terrorism in Pakistan from Afghanistan, the ISPR said in a statement. \n\"Most of the incidents in Pakistan are claimed by terrorist organisations with leadership hiding in Afghanistan,\" Gen Bajwa told US General John Nicholson. \n\"The COAS said that such terrorist activities and inaction against them are testing our current policy of cross-border restraint,\" the ISPR said in a statement. \nThe attack in Sehwan came as part of a recent wave of terrorist attacks in the country, and the fifth blast in less than a week targeting innocent people. \nOn February 15, three suicide bombers targeted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the adjoining tribal areas leaving around seven people dead. One of the incidents occurred in Peshawar where a suicide bomber riding a motorbike hit a vehicle carrying civil judges, while two other suicide bombers blew themselves up at separate locations in Mohmand Agency. \nEarlier to these, a suicide attack in Lahore on February 13 killed 14 people and wounded over 60 others. \nOn February 12, a cameraman, Taimur from Samaa News was killed when the channelâ€™s DSNG van was attacked in Karachi. 0 0 Pak army launches second massive assault against militant hideouts near Afghan border was posted in pakistan of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on February 19, 2017 and was last updated on February 19, 2017.
