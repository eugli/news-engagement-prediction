Obviously, most people do have to file. But if your gross income was low enough last year, you may be off the hook.\nHow low is low enough? See the gross income maximums in the table below which depend on your age and marital status as of Dec. 31, 2016 and certain other factors explained in this article. If your gross income was below the applicable magic number, you probably don’t need to file a Form 1040 for last year.\nAlso see: 45% of Americans pay no federal income tax\nGross income basically means potentially taxable income from all sources, including income from outside the U.S. (even if the tax rules allow you to exclude all or part of that income). Don’t include Social Security benefits unless you use married filing separate status and lived with your spouse at any time during 2016. However, if you received Social Security benefits, you will need to do a separate calculation using the worksheet provided in the Form 1040 instructions to see if any of your benefits are taxable. If they are, you generally must file a return.\nFiling Status: Single\nUnder 65, gross income threshold = $10,350 65 or older, gross income threshold = $11,900 Filing status: Head of household\nUnder 65, gross income threshold = $13,350 65 or older, gross income threshold = $14,900 Filing Status: Married, filing jointly\nBoth spouses under 65, gross income threshold = $20,700 One spouse 65 or older, gross income threshold = $21,950 Both spouses 65 or older, gross income threshold = $23,200 If you file jointly but weren’t living with your spouse as of Dec. 31, 2016 (or on the date your spouse died, if applicable), you must file a return (regardless of your age) if your 2016 gross income exceeded $4,050.\nFiling Status: Married, filing separately\nAny age, gross income threshold = $4,050 Filing Status: Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child\nUnder 65, gross income threshold = $16,650 65 or older, gross income threshold = $17,900 If your spouse died in 2014 or 2015, and you had at least one dependent child during 2016, you can file as a qualifying widow or widower for 2016. If you qualify, this means you can calculate your federal income tax bill using the more-favorable standard deduction amount and tax bracket amounts for joint filers.\nDifferent rules if you are a dependent\nReduced gross income thresholds apply if you’re claimed as a dependent on another person’s Form 1040 for 2016. In this case, you cannot file jointly with your spouse if you’re married (you must file using married filing separate status in order to be claimed as a dependent on another person’s return). The following income thresholds are based on the 2016 standard deduction and personal exemption amounts, and they depend on which of the following four scenarios you fit into.\nScenario 1: You were unmarried (and not age 65 or older or blind) at the end of 2016. You must file a 2016 return if:\nYou had more than $1,050 of unearned income in 2015 (typically from investments).\nYou had more than $6,300 of earned income (typically from a job or self-employment activity).\nYou had gross income in excess of the larger of: (1) $1,050 or (2) your earned income amount (counting no more than $5,950 of earned income) plus $350. For example, say you had $5,200 of gross income of which $800 was from unearned income and $4,400 was from earned income. Because your gross income exceeded $4,750 ($4,400 of earned income plus $350), you must file under this rule.\nScenario 2: You were unmarried and age 65 or older or blind at the end of 2016. You must file a 2016 return if:\nYou had more than $2,600 of unearned income in 2015 (or more than $4,150 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nYou had more than $7,850 of earned income (or more than $9,400 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nYou had gross income in excess of the larger of: (1) $2,600 (or $4,150 if you are both at least 65 and blind) or (2) your earned income amount (counting no more than $5,950 of earned income) plus $1,900 (or plus $3,450 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nScenario 3: You were married (and not age 65 or older or blind) at the end of 2016. You must file a 2016 return if:\nYou personally had more than $1,050 of unearned income in 2015.\nYou personally had more than $6,300 of earned income.\nYou personally had gross income in excess of the larger of: (1) $1,050 or (2) your earned income amount (counting no more than $5,950 of earned income) plus $350. For example, say you had $2,900 of gross income of which $600 was from unearned income and $2,300 was from earned income. Because your gross income exceeded $2,650 ($2,300 of earned income plus $350), you must file under this rule.\nYou personally had gross income of at least $5 and your spouse files a separate return and itemizes deductions.\nYour spouse must look at the same rules to see if he or she is also required to file a return (using married filing separate status).\nScenario 4: You were married and age 65 or older or blind at the end of 2016. You must file a 2016 return if:\nYou personally had more than $2,300 of unearned income in 2015 (or more than $3,550 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nYou personally had more than $7,550 of earned income (or more than $8,800 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nYou had gross income in excess of the larger of: (1) $2,300 (or $3,550 if you are both 65 or older and blind) or (2) your earned income amount (counting no more than $5,950 of earned income) plus $1,600 (or plus $2,850 if you are both 65 or older and blind).\nYou personally had gross income of at least $5 and your spouse files a separate return and itemizes deductions.\nYour spouse must look at the same rules to see if he or she is also required to file a return (using married filing separate status).\nOther situations where filing is required\nRegardless of your gross income, you must file a 2016 Form 1040 if you are in any of the following situations.\n* You owe any “special taxes” for 2016 such as the alternative minimum tax, the self-employment tax, special taxes related to an IRA or qualified retirement plan account (such as the 10% penalty tax on IRA withdrawals before age 59 1/2), or federal employment taxes for a household employee. (This isn't an exhaustive list of “special taxes.”)\n* You received advanced earned income credit payments from your employer in 2016 (these are shown on your 2016 Form W-2).\n* Your health insurance company received advance premium tax credit payments in 2016 to help pay your premiums (advance payments should be shown on a 2016 Form 1095-A sent to you by the health insurance exchange where you bought your coverage).\n* You had net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more for 2016.\n* You had wages of $108.28 or more in 2013 from a church or church-controlled organization that is exempt from Social Security and Medicare taxes.\nEven if you don’t have to, you may still want to file if…\nSay your 2015 gross income was low enough that you’re not required to file Form 1040 for last year. Great, but it may be a good idea to file anyway. Here’s why.\n* You may be due a federal income tax refund for 2016, for example, because of the refundable earned-income tax credit or the refundable child tax credit. No 2016 return means no refund.\n* Until your 2016 return is filed, the three-year statute of limitations period for the commencement of an IRS audit won’t start. So the IRS could decide to audit your 2016 tax situation five years (or more) from now, and hit you with a tax bill plus interest and penalties. In contrast, if you file a 2016 return showing zero federal income tax liability, the IRS generally must begin any audit of your 2016 tax year within three years of the filing date.\n* If you had an overall capital loss for 2016 caused by investment losses, you can carry that loss forward to future tax years and offset otherwise taxable capital gains in those years. However, you must file a 2016 return to establish that you incurred a tax-saving capital loss carry-over last year.\n* If you had an overall net operating loss (NOL) for 2016 caused by business losses, you can carry the NOL as far back as 2014 tax year and possibly claim a refund. Alternatively, you can choose to carry the NOL forward to future tax years and offset otherwise taxable income earned in those years. However, you must file a 2016 return to establish that you generated a tax-saving NOL last year.\nThe last word\nJust because you aren't required to file a federal Form 1040 doesn’t necessarily mean you’re also excused from filing state and/or local income tax returns. Check on that before concluding you’re entirely in the clear.\nThis story has been updated.\nMore from MarketWatch Personal Finance How to write off medical expenses on your taxes 7 things you should never do when filing your taxes Why so many sports stars run into tax troubles Related Topics Taxes Tax Credits Capital Gains Tax Income Tax Property Taxes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:06:49.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
