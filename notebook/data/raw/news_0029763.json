Article continues below \nJust as he was for the Foxes, N'Golo Kante has been the lynchpin of Chelsea's midfield. \nPremier League teams only just seem to be waking up to the Frenchman's brilliance, but it's no coincidence that he's on course to win the title in two successive seasons. Article continues below \nNo player in the modern era has achieved that with different teams, yet it just goes to show how instrumental the 25-year-old has been. \nTo cut a long story short, he's simply been unreal. \nKante has to be among the favourites for PFA Player of the Year, and he's been backed to win the accolade by former two-time holder Thierry Henry. Unreal talent \nWriting in The Sun, the Arsenal legend felt the need to confirm what we've all questioned at some point since Kante arrived in England 18 months ago - is he actually human? \n\"I was at the Chelsea training ground last week to see Eden Hazard and noticed N’Golo Kante wandering back to the changing rooms,\" Henry said. \n\"So I went over to him and stood in front of him. And I poked him in the chest. \n\"I had to, just to check if he was real! “You are real, you are!” I said, and he laughed. Well, he may be real — but he’s certainly not normal. \n\"I see no reason why he shouldn’t be PFA Player of the Year at the end of the season.\" The Premier League's finest? \nYou can hardly blame him - Kante literally plays like an alien. He's unstoppable. \nHenry also gave honourable mentions to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexis Sanchez, and Romelu Lukaku, but he clearly thinks Chelsea's status as champions-elect could swing the award for Kante. \n\"Barring a catastrophe, Chelsea will be champions so the winner will probably come from them\", he added. \n\"Kante reads mistakes before they’ve been made. He reads the bounce of the ball before the ball knows where it’s going!\" \nShould Kante win Player of the Year? Let us know your candidates in the comments. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
