Both models will be available for purchase sometime this spring. \nMore specifically, the Huawei P10 will launch in Canada through local network operators Bell, Rogers, Videotron and Fido, whereas the larger, more powerful Huawei P10 Plus will be distributed exclusively through Rogers. Pricing details are currently missing and it’s unclear whether the Huawei P10 Plus will ever be launched in Canada through other channels aside Rogers. However, it’s worth noting that the president of Huawei Canada did mention that the company is looking forward to working with all the aforementioned carriers “and others”, so there is a chance that availability for both smartphones will continue to expand. As a point of reference, the Huawei P10 will be launched in Europe sometime in March for the price of €649, whereas the Huawei P10 Plus will be accompanied by a price tag of €699. \nThe Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus share some similarities across the board, including the Kirin 960 System-on-Chip housing four ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.4 GHz, and four ARM Cortex-A53 cores operating at frequencies of up to 1.8 GHz. Both smartphone models will be available with 4 GB of RAM, but the Huawei P10 Plus will also be launched with an optional 6 GB of RAM on-board. The Huawei P10 boasts 64 GB of internal memory whereas the Huawei P10 Plus will be available with 64 GB or 128 GB on-board storage. Otherwise, the former model packs a 5.1-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display covered in Corning Gorilla Glass 5, whereas the latter variant accommodates a 5.5-inch panel with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. Lastly, the 5.1-inch model draws energy from a 3,200 mAh battery, while the Huawei P10 Plus makes use of a 3,750 mAh unit. Both smartphones run Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and will be available in a wide variety of colors, including Rose Gold, Ceramic White, Mystic Silver, Greenery, Graphite Black, Dazzling Gold, and Dazzling Blue.
