Santana last year reunited with some members of his late-'60s band for \"Santana IV.\" Maybe IV sounded too medical. Or maybe he's a fan of machines made of cardboard boxes .\nRegardless tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Feb. 10 through Ticketmaster .\nThis already has been a busy week for show announcements. Lady Gaga this morning followed her Super Bowl appearance with an announcement of a World Tour that hits Houston in December .\nAnd the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion continues to unveil its summer lineup. The venue announced a John Legend date on May 21 and a twofer of Deftones and Rise Against on June 26. Jimmy Eat World and Incubus will play there Aug. 4.
