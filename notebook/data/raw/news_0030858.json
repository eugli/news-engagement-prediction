The company dominated the 2017 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards , winning awards in 10 categories. Viking Sea won best overall ship in the small-mid size ship category, best entertainment, best service, best fitness, best public rooms and best shore excursions. Its sister ship Viking Star won for best dining, best cabins, best value and best for first-time cruisers in the same size category. Viking is known for its excellent service and inclusive pricing. \"The Cruisers' Choice Awards are particularly important because they are based on reviews submitted to Cruise Critic over the past year and directly reflect the experiences people had on their cruise,\" said Colleen McDaniel, Cruise Critic's senior executive editor.

Reviews offer a really good starting point for planning a cruise, to help you to narrow down your choices.\" The awards are based on consumer reviews and ratings by members of the Cruise Critic website. Disney's appeal goes beyond children Disney Cruise Line took eight awards this year, a drop from its dominating total of 11 awards in 2016 . But the Disney awards demonstrated the appeal of the cruise line beyond child-centered travel. Disney Magic did win the award for best overall ship for families, but most of the company's awards were not for family appeal. Magic won for best overall ship in the midsize ship category, while the larger Disney Dream won for best overall large ship for the third year in a row. The Dream also won for best service, best public rooms, best cabins and best shore excursions, while the Fantasy won for best fitness and recreation. Disney's Oceaneer Club and Lab features a Magic PlayFloor for kids. Celebrity Xpedition, the Celebrity Cruise Line ship based in the Galapagos, won six awards in the small ship category: best overall ship, best embarkation, best fitness, best public rooms, best value and best shore excursions. The awards are given in four ship categories, based on passenger capacity. Large ships carry 2,000 or more passengers; midsize ships carry 1,200 to 1,999 passengers; small-mid size ships carry 400-1,199 passengers; and small ships carry fewer than 400 passengers. 2017 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards Best Cruise Overall Disney Dream (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Disney Magic (midsize) -- Disney Cruise Line Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) -- Celebrity Cruises Best Cruise Ship Cabins Disney Dream (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Marina (midsize) -- Oceania Cruises Viking Star (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Star Legend (small) -- Windstar Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Dining Celebrity Reflection (large) -- Celebrity Cruises Marina (midsize) -- Oceania Cruises Viking Star (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Wind Surf (small) -- Windstar Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Embarkation Celebrity Reflection (large) -- Celebrity Cruises Celestyal Crystal (midsize) -- Celestyal Cruises Pacific Princess (small-mid) -- Princess Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) -- Celebrity Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Entertainment Allure of the Seas (large) -- Royal Caribbean International Celestyal Crystal (midsize) -- Celestyal Cruises Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Silver Shadow (small) -- Silversea Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Fitness & Recreation Disney Fantasy (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Marina (midsize) -- Oceania Cruises Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) -- Celebrity Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Public Rooms Disney Dream (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Marina (midsize) -- Oceania Cruises Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) -- Celebrity Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Service Disney Dream (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Marina (midsize) -- Oceania Cruises Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Paul Gauguin (small) -- Paul Gauguin Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Shore Excursions Disney Dream (large) -- Disney Cruise Line Celestyal Crystal (midsize) -- Celestyal Cruises Viking Sea (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) -- Celebrity Cruises Best Cruise Ships for Value Norwegian Sky (large) -- Norwegian Cruise Line Celestyal Crystal (midsize) -- Celestyal Cruises Viking Star (small-mid) -- Viking Ocean Cruises Celebrity Xpedition (small) - Celebrity Cruises Best Cruises for Families Disney Magic -- Disney Cruise Line Best for First Timers Viking Star -- Viking Ocean Cruises", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:44:35.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
