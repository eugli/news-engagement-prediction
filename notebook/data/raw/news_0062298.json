Ask Harpreet Singh Bhatia, an young cricketer from Madhya Pradesh. \nThe left-handed batsman who was in good form was hoping to make it big at the IPL auction on Monday but he remained unsold. \nHarpreet Singh/ Facebook \nThe 25-year-old's fortunes turned on its head after a goof-up by news agencies. It all started earlier in the day when Harmeet Singh, a member of the 2012 Under-19 World Cup winning Indian team was arrested by police for driving his car on to the platform no.1 of Andheri railway station. \nPTI \nBut instead of Harmeet Singh, two news agencies, ANI and PTI initially reported that name of the arrested cricketer is Harpreet Singh Bhatia. #Mumbai U-19 cricketer Harmeet Singh who was then arrested for the offence, was granted bail by Andheri court thereafter. â€” ANI (@ANI_news) February 22, 2017 \nEven though the two agencies later corrected their mistake, the damage had already been done. \nHarpreet Singh believes he went unsold because franchises mistook him for Harmeet Singh, who was still in custody at the time of the auction.
