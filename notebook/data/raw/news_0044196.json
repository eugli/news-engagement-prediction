Alford coolly walked toward the sideline, where he high-fived a few fans before doing the same with his UCLA ... (Ben Bolch) \nWith 6:54 left in the game, Alford hit a long three-pointer to give the Bruins a 15-point lead. Moments later, he was hammered on a layup yet somehow banked the ball into the basket while falling to the floor. \nWhen he stood up, he was snarling. That’s right, nice Bryce Alford was twisting his face into a Kobe Bryant jaw while slapping hands with courtside fans. \nOne didn’t need to see the scoreboard — which read 79-61 after his free throw — to know the game was over. One didn’t need to look at box scores to figure that Alford, who made one basket in the previous loss to USC, finished this game with redemption, eight baskets and 26 points. \nBut, hey, if you did want to look at the box score, in the first meeting last month, USC ran past the Bruins with four guards and swarmed them into 17 turnovers in an eight-point victory. \nThis time, the Bruins ran smack over the Trojans, making more than half of their shots while holding USC to 34% shooting and outrebounding the Trojans by 17. Those turnovers dropped to 10, which, along with 23 assists and five players in double-figure scoring, is the definition of “team win.” \nFor the record, Alford’s biggest three came with 1:59 left when he nailed a bomb that gave the Bruins 10 three-pointers and everyone in the building a free chicken sandwich. He strutted a little bit after that, and who could blame him? \nUCLA is now 24-3 and still leading the nation in points and assists per game. For the Trojans, it was a missed opportunity to further prove themselves nationally. Entering the night, they were off to their best start in 25 years, at 21-5, yet still unranked and uncertain of a decent tournament seeding. \nYeah, this game under these conditions would have proven a lot for the Trojans. \nPauley was filled and loud, equaling the furious emotions that filled Galen Center last month. \nCaitlyn Jenner showed up and was cheered. Travis Kalanick, a UCLA graduate and co-founder of Uber, showed up and was booed. Derrick Rose of the New York Knicks also showed up and the response was, like, what? \nUCLA plays USC in a Pac 12 basketball game \nThe biggest star, just like in the first meeting between these two teams and in the Dodgers’ home playoff games, was national anthem singer Keith Williams Jr. As always when Williams sings, the crowd roared in wonder and delight, and seriously, how does he hit some of those notes? \nAnd when the game began, the Trojans were also singing. With 7:57 left in the first half, they led 23-18. Then Isaac Hamilton hit a jumper to start UCLA on a 28-9 run to end the half with the Bruins leading, 46-34, setting the tone for the rest of the game. \nThe comeback was fueled with defense, Thomas Welsh blocking Chimezie Metu, Gyorgy Goloman forcing Elijah Stewart out of bounds, hands in face, help coming from everywhere. \nAnd, of course, the comeback was also fueled with shooting, Bryce Alford hitting two three-pointers, TJ Leaf active everywhere around the basket and, finally, Lonzo Ball with his usual dramatics. \nIn the final seconds of the half, just past the midcourt line, Ball dribbled and dribbled and then sank one of his from-the-hip threes to end the half with UCLA leading by a dozen. \nOf course he did. It’s what he does. And for once, beating USC was something UCLA actually did, a night of growth, from the chill of late January into the oncoming heat of March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:55:37.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
