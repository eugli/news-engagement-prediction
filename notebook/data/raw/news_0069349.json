His transplanted heart helped revive a critically ill infant boy, and his liver went to another infant who has been thriving.\nStill, overwhelming feelings of grief and anger dominate Keane’s day-to-day life six months after her 1-year-old son, Noah Larson, died of traumatic head injuries while he and his twin sister, Emelia, were being cared for by a baby sitter.\nAdvertisement\nNo charges have been filed, even as a state document shows that doctors also detected old skull fractures on both children and a judge has preliminarily found that the twins’ injuries likely occurred at the baby sitter’s home.\nKeane fears her son’s case — and perhaps other infant murder investigations in Massachusetts — are languishing because prosecutors and assistant medical examiners may be hesitant to pursue child-abuse cases after recent courtroom setbacks.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Also, in the past few years, Middlesex County prosecutors dropped two infant murder cases — involving the deaths of a Cambridge girl and a Malden boy — after the state medical examiner’s office changed the manner of the deaths from homicide to “undetermined.”\nAdvertisement\nIn most of these cases, defense attorneys argued that the child’s fatal bleeding or fractures resulted from relatively rare medical disorders, or may have been due to accidents such as short falls from a couch.\nA spokeswoman for Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan declined to comment on the probe into the death of Keane’s baby, other than to say the medical examiner’s office has yet to release a manner of death and that “the investigation is active and ongoing.”\nTo Keane, the evidence is strong that the baby sitter — or possibly someone else in the baby sitter’s home — fatally assaulted Noah on Aug. 15, 2016. She also provided the Globe with a document from the state’s child-protection agency that says in part, “the current facts point to Noah’s fatal injury having been sustained while in the home of his babysitter.”\nThat same document from the Department of Children and Families noted another disturbing aspect of the case: It said doctors found that both twins had old skull fractures on the back of their heads, likely a week or so old, suggesting abuse occurred prior to Noah’s fatal injuries. The twin sister also had some healing fractures near her ribs and limbs, Keane said.\nKeane acknowledged that someone, other than the baby sitter, could have had access to her twins while they were at the baby sitter’s one-bedroom apartment. For about a year, the sitter primarily received the twins when they came, but sometimes the sitter’s husband was there, as well as some other relatives. The sitter also cared for her own toddler while watching the twins, Keane said.\nJoanne Rathe/ Globe Staff\nLindsey Keane held a pillow with the photo of her son, Noah.\nKeane said she had a good relationship with the sitter — a former friend of Keane’s — and paid her $65 a day to care for the twins while she worked part time in office jobs and sales and the twins’ father, Paul Larson, 26, worked as a solar energy surveyor.\nThe Globe attempted to reach the baby sitter for her account, but was unsuccessful.\nWhen the old injuries were discovered, Keane said, state investigators also felt the need to check out whether she or Paul could be responsible. Social workers temporarily removed Emelia and Keane’s 7-year-old daughter, from a different relationship, from the Woburn apartment that she and Paul shared. The two children were placed with grandparents.\nKeane said she understood the need for those precautions, and sought to be open with investigators, including about all the ups and downs that she and Paul have experienced as young, sometimes struggling, parents.\nShe said they were reunited with the children three weeks later. Records show state investigators began focusing on what happened in the baby sitter’s home, and a judge concluded it was also highly unlikely multiple people assaulted the twins.\nA spokeswoman for the DCF declined to say if the baby sitter’s child remains in her custody.\nChild-protection advocates say it’s too early to say whether prosecutors have become timid in the wake of recent courtroom challenges.\nThey say many infant homicide cases that rely primarily on medical evidence are known to take months, if not years, to develop, and some never go forward because of a lack of solid evidence to convict an individual.\nIn a different county, the cause of another baby’s death is also pending. A spokeswoman for the Plymouth County district attorney’s office said that “the investigation is ongoing” into the death last December of a 2-year-old Brockton child, who apparently suffered head injuries while in the care of the mother’s boyfriend.\nThese days, Keane said she does everything in her power to draw public attention to Noah’s death, hoping prosecutors don’t forget her brown-haired, mild-mannered son who had a smile for everyone.\nThrough tears, she said she often revisits that moment when she got the call from the sitter saying Noah was unresponsive, and then paramedics were called. She said she has to live with the belief that she made a child care decision that proved deadly, even though the setup once seemed quite ideal.\n“She was someone we trusted,” Keane said.\nPatricia Wen can be reached at patricia.wen@globe.com .
