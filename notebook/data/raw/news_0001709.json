Line a rimmed baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil. 2 Scrub the skin of the potatoes clean. Use a vegetable brush and running water to remove any dirt and grime off the skin of the sweet potatoes. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/79/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-2-Version-2.jpg /6/6f/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 2 Version 2.360p.mp4 3 Pierce the exterior of each sweet potato. Use the tines of a fork to make holes in the skin of each potato, piercing the potato three or four times. Place the pierced sweet potatoes on the prepared baking sheet. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/25/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-3-Version-2.jpg /f/fc/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 3 Version 2.360p.mp4 4 Bake the uncovered sweet potatoes in the oven. The sweet potatoes need to bake until they become tender, which will usually take between 45 - 60 minutes. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-4-Version-2.jpg /9/90/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 4 Version 2.360p.mp4 5 Soften the flesh. Place each sweet potato inside a clean kitchen towel. Roll the potato on the counter, pressing on it gently. Doing so loosens the flesh inside. 6 Cut open each sweet potato. Use a knife to slit open each potato from one end to the other. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/6/60/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-6-Version-2.jpg /3/37/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 6 Version 2.360p.mp4 7 Serve the sweet potatoes hot with butter, salt, and pepper. Each sweet potato should be topped with about 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of butter. Add salt and pepper to taste. Method Making Microwave Baked Sweet Potatoes 1 Scrub the sweet potatoes clean. Wash the exterior of each sweet potato under running water, using a vegetable brush to remove any stubborn dirt. 2 Pierce the skin. Poke into each sweet potato three to five times with the tines of a fork. 3 Place the sweet potatoes in a microwave-safe dish. You can also use a microwave-safe plate with a rim. Do not cover. 4 Microwave the sweet potatoes until tender. Set the microwave on full power and cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Pause the microwave halfway in between to flip and rotate the sweet potatoes to ensure even cooking. 5 Slice open each sweet potato. Cut an \"X\" in the top of each potato and gently press on the sides of the skin to push the flesh upward. 6 Serve with butter. Use about 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) of butter per sweet potato. Add salt and pepper to taste. Method Making Slow Cooked Sweet Potatoes 1 Wash the sweet potatoes. Scrub the skin with a vegetable brush under running water. 2 Poke holes in the skin. Use the tines of a fork to pierce the outside of each sweet potato several times, covering the exterior in tiny holes. 3 Place the sweet potatoes into a 5 or 6 quart (5 or 6 liter) slow cooker. The sweet potatoes can be piled up near the top, but you should still be able to cover the slow cooker with a lid without any difficulty. 4 Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 120 ml) water to the slow cooker. A little water will help the sweet potatoes cook better, but there should not be enough water to cover them. You do not want them to boil in the slow cooker. Instead, the water is there to prevent the sweet potatoes from drying out and potentially burning. 5 Cook the sweet potatoes for 4 to 6 hours. Cover the slow cooker and set the heat to low, cooking the sweet potatoes until they become tender. 6 Slice open and serve. Cut the sweet potatoes open with a knife or fork. They should be tender enough to fall apart without needing to loosen the flesh using other techniques. Add 6 tbsp. of butter and salt and pepper to taste before serving. Method Making Mashed Sweet Potatoes 1 Peel and cube the sweet potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from each sweet potato. Cut each one into 1/2-in. (1.27-cm) cubes. Place these cubes in a colander and rinse with running water to remove any traces of dirt. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/9/96/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-20-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-20-Version-2.jpg /c/c1/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 20 Version 2.360p.mp4 2 Transfer the sweet potato cubes into a 4 quart (4 liter) pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover the cubes. Add a dash of salt to the water. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ed/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-21-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-21-Version-2.jpg /e/e5/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 21 Version 2.360p.mp4 3 Boil the sweet potatoes for 12 minutes. You can add a pinch of salt to the pot if you like. Cover the pot and heat the water and cubed sweet potatoes over medium-high to high heat, until they feel tender when pierced with a fork. 4 Drain the water. Pour the contents of the pot through a colander. Separate the water out and return the potatoes to the pot. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/2/22/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-23-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-23-Version-2.jpg /e/e0/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 23 Version 2.360p.mp4 5 Add the butter to the sweet potatoes. You can add anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of butter, depending on how creamy you want the mashed sweet potatoes to be. Allow the butter to sit on the hot sweet potatoes until it melts, stirring as necessary to speed up the melting process. 6 Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher. Smash the sweet potatoes and butter together using the masher until the mixture becomes smooth. http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-25-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-25-Version-2.jpg http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/7/7e/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-25-Version-2.jpg/300px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-25-Version-2.jpg /6/65/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 25 Version 2.360p.mp4 If you do not have a potato masher, you can also use a hand-held electric mixer. 7 Add the remaining ingredients. Stir in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of sour cream and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of milk and add salt and pepper to taste. Continue stirring with a large spoon or fork until the mixture is creamy and thoroughly combined. http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/c/cf/Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-26-Version-2.jpg/550px-Cook-Sweet-Potatoes-Step-26-Version-2.jpg /3/36/Cook Sweet Potatoes Step 26 Version 2.360p.mp4 8 Return the pot to the oven. Cook the mashed sweet potatoes over low heat, stirring frequently, until the sweet potatoes are heated through. Then, serve them while they're hot.
