Each day, we all encounter millions of germs. Yet most of us stay healthy most of the time thanks to a combination of our immune system and preventive health measures such as washing our hands, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep. To preserve your cyberhealth, you must similarly strengthen your defenses by supplementing antivirus software (think of it as your imperfect cyber immune system) with a diversity of preventive digital tools and habits that can help keep malware and hackers from reaching you in the first place. \nFirst, antivirus software can still play an important role. No matter how much you wash your hands, some infection will inevitably get through. While other security practices can help you avoid malware and prevent hackers from breaching your online accounts, no other consumer tool will recognize malware in downloads and emails. In 2013, Microsoft said that unprotected computers are 5.5 times more likely to be infected than those that run real-time antivirus protection. Most well-known brands provide both real-time monitoring and malware removal. \nPremium products like Norton Security Deluxe, McAfee Total Protection, and Kaspersky Total Security may provide a higher level of customer service, but free products from brands like AVG and Avira provide a similar level of overall protection. While Windows users can use Microsoft’s native antivirus software, Mac users will need to find a third-party product (although Macs are generally at lower risk of infection due to Apple’s smaller market share). Whatever solution you choose, it is essential to turn on automatic updates. According to a 2014 study by Microsoft, having expired or out-of-date antivirus software is nearly as bad as having none at all. Advertisement \nWith all its flaws, however, people need to take other steps to ensure a robust digital defense. This is the wash your hands, eat nutritious foods, and get enough sleep part that, like a parent, cybersecurity experts (and Future Tensers) like to nag users about. Among them: Install updates for all of your software—not just antivirus programs. In 2016, a Sophos researcher reported that nearly half of malware attacks involving Microsoft Office target a vulnerability Microsoft patched in 2012. Get a password manager . (If you are on a budget, it is better to use your limited funds on a password manager than on premium antivirus software.) Set up two-factor authentication , use unique passwords for each account, encrypt your computers and phones , and please, please create backups of your devices. Though these tools alone won’t keep you safe from malware, they will help protect your personal data should a virus breach your defenses. \nHealthy digital habits also make a big difference for individual protection. The simplest advice for online safety comes via cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs : First, if you didn’t go looking for it, don’t install it. Second, if you installed it, update it. Third, if you no longer need it, get rid of it! Mostly, use common sense: You wouldn’t eat a piece of candy off the ground. Yet in 2008, a U.S. soldier sparked one of the largest data breaches in military history by using a USB stick he found in the parking lot outside his base. \nAntivirus may not be dead yet, but it’s probably time to call hospice. While this calls to mind the old joke that the best way to secure a computer is to pull the plug, giving up is not an option for most of us. If you haven’t previously taken your cybersecurity seriously, now is a great time to start. For the quantity and intimate quality of the information we trust to our devices is transforming our relationship to data. In some important ways, we no longer simply own our information. We are our information. \nThis article is part of the cybersecurity self-defense installment of Futurography , a series in which Future Tense introduces readers to the technologies that will define tomorrow . Each month, we’ll choose a new technology and break it down. Future Tense is a collaboration among Arizona State University , New America , and Slate . \nMichael Thornton is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge, researching the philosophy of cybersecurity, and a former director of product management.
