Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP Australian politics Malcolm Turnbull's new expenses authority to have weaker powers than many civil regulators \nBody would have less teeth than Asic, ACCC and tax office and shield some MPs who incorrectly claim entitlements from publicity View more sharing options Thursday 9 February 2017 01.51 GMT Last modified on Thursday 9 February 2017 09.04 GMT \nMalcolm Turnbull has introduced legislation to create a new independent parliamentary expenses authority to advise, audit and rule on politicians’ use of taxpayer-funded entitlements. \nTurnbull committed the government to implement recommendations of the Conde review of expenses , a further bill to fix the expenses framework and revealed an interim body established by executive order would police politicians until the new authority is set up. \nBut the bill included a number of measures that may shield parliamentarians in breach of rules, including not requiring them to produce evidence that incriminates themselves or others and a discretion for the body not to give a public report where it might cause “serious harm” to any person. LNP senator calls to reinstate Life Gold Pass for former MPs – politics live Read more \nTurnbull announced the independent authority in January after Sussan Ley resigned as health minister over several controversial taxpayer-funded travel claims, including charging for a trip to the Gold Coast in which she bought a $795,000 apartment . \nIn a speech to the House of Representatives on Thursday, Turnbull said the authority would ensure that parliamentarians’ work expenses are “accountable, transparent and fair”. \nIts core functions are to advise parliamentarians on expenses, monitor their use, process and audit claims and make rulings about expenses, including making orders for politicians to pay back claims in breach of rules. \nTurnbull said the modernisation of the expense system would have the greatest impact, promising to speed up disclosure from six-monthly to monthly reports in an “accessible and searchable format”. \nThe bill specifies only that reporting must be “regular” because, as the accompanying memorandum explains, reporting will transition first to quarterly then monthly reporting. \nThe bill gives the independent expenses authority the power to publish reports on parliamentarians’ use of entitlements. \nIn January Turnbull refused to release the report of the investigation into Ley by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, citing the fact it was a report to himself and the cabinet governance committee. \nSection 60 of the bill provides a number of instances in which the authority is forbidden to publish reports, including when it or the attorney general believes a report would harm security, defence or international relations. \nA further exemption is where the authority believes disclosure is “likely to result in serious harm to the individual, or any of the individuals, to whom the information relates”. The explanatory memorandum says that is limited to “physical or mental harm” and is designed to prevent “misuse” of information. Malcolm Turnbull boasts of standing up to billionaires while defending attack on Shorten Read more \nParliament and its committees cannot compel the authority to release a report in those circumstances. \nThe bill gives the authority power to order politicians or others to give it documents, but section 55 allows them to refuse the order if the information “might tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty”. \nThat means the authority will have weaker powers than many civil regulators including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Building and Construction Commission whose regimes don’t allow people to refuse on the basis of a privilege against self-incrimination . \nAt a press conference in Canberra on Thursday, Bill Shorten said he would study the bill but Labor had offered bipartisan support for the expenses authority. \nShorten said expenses are an issue for everyone because people “turn off politics ... when they think that the politicians are in it for themselves and not the people”. \nTurnbull said an independent board and decisions made at arm’s length from the government would give the public confidence in its decisions. \nThe board will be made up of a chair, the president of the remuneration tribunal, a former judge, a former member of parliament, and a person with substantial experience in auditing. \nWhen the bill is passed the expenses authority will be established on July 1. In the meantime an advisory body established by executive order will provide advice on expenses.
