(AFP Photo) PUNE: Australia's Matt Renshaw became the latest in a long line of visiting cricketers to be laid low by an upset stomach in India when he had to retire mid-innings during the first Test in Pune on Thursday. After receiving criticism from former Australian captain Allan Border , and plenty of other comments on social media, Renshaw later returned to the crease to continue his knock. A look at some of the other players struck by illness in India: The 1986 match between India and Australia in Chennai is remembered by statisticians as one of cricket's two tied Tests but for Australian fans, it is synonymous with an epic double century by an ailing Dean Jones . In his comeback Test after a two-year absence, Jones began feeling nauseous through dehydration soon after passing the 100-mark in a match played in near 40 degree heat. After he began vomiting on the side of the pitch, Jones intimated that he wanted to retire hurt, but received short shrift from his skipper Allan Border. \"He said: 'If you can't hack it, let's get a tough Queenslander out here!',\" Jones, who hails from Victoria, recalled in interview with Cricinfo. Jones did indeed tough it out, going out to make 210 but lost seven kilograms in the process and ended up in hospital on a saline drip. The side's veteran coach Bobby Simpson later described it as the greatest innings ever played by an Australian. During a Test in Bangalore in November 1988, so many of New Zealand's players were floored by a stomach bug that former captain Jeremy Coney and another TV commentator had to be drafted in as substitute fielders. Fast bowler Ewen Chatfield was so badly affected that when he began his run-up for a delivery after lunch, he carried on straight to the pavilion to answer a call of nature -- much to the bemusement of the umpires. Little surprise then that India won by 172 runs. But the match holds fond memories for Richard Hadlee , who became the highest wicket taker in Test history -- despite also being one of his team's casualties. The 3-0 defeat on their 1993 tour of India is remembered as one of England's lowest points, with the nadir coming in Chennai when skipper Graham Gooch ate a dodgy prawn on the eve of the second Test. Gooch was so sick on the morning of the match that he had to hand over the captaincy to Alec Stewart . Mike Gatting , his dining companion at the guilty Chinese restaurant, also fell ill during the match along with Robin Smith who had reportedly eaten a plate of chicken in the hotel. The Wisden Almanack joked that England \"were well beaten by 11 men and a plate of prawns\" as India won the match by an innings and 22 runs. Food for the rest of the tour was prepared in-house and was said to have consisted of a diet of baked beans, corned beef and naan bread.
