It’s beginning to put out the tools,” Rosenbluth said. \n’s secret sauce is behavioral science based on research by the University of Pennsylvania, said Rosenbluth, cofounder of Conshohocken-based Take Care Health Clinics Inc., which was sold to Walgreens for $250 million in 2008. \n’ health and wellness division, Rosenbluth learned what does not work by looking at possible acquisition targets for Walgreens. \nWe walked away from all of them because you would have limited engagement, and then people would drop off,” Rosenbluth, who served in that role until 2012, said in an interview last week. “They didn’t use behavioral economics to create the pathway for people to be engaged.” \n’s offices, software developers sit under flat screens displaying their work. “Someone might see a shortcut,” said Rosenbluth, wearing the cowboy boots that hint at his attachment to a 3,000-acre North Dakota ranch. \n’s first customer, Independence Blue Cross, which also invested $2.4 million in New Ocean two years ago when it was called CareCam Health Systems and had a narrower focus on helping people with chronic conditions. \nYou’re going to motivate a mother of four in the suburbs a lot differently than an aging senior who wants to stay at home in the city. We love that aspect of getting a lot more personalized,” said Lobley. He also said it was important that New Ocean was building its program from the ground up for mobile devices. \n’s program starts with what it calls a “private-health assessment,” as opposed to a health-risk assessment, a term that scares people off, Rosenbluth said. \n’s algorithms will generate a very different program for a senior with diabetes and congestive heart failure than for a millennial who goes to the gym five days a week. \nOh, wow, you’re actually talking about me,” as opposed to a generic insured member carrying an Independence Blue Cross card, Lobley said, describing the impression he hopes New Ocean’s system makes on users. \nVal Health , whose cofounders include David Asch and Kevin Volpp at Penn. \nIf they go with the program, they will continue to have the 80-20 split. Plus, they’ll get these monetary awards, which could save them $100 a month on their medical costs,” Rosenbluth said of his employees. \nIf they don’t do this. Then the 80 percent will be reduced to 75 percent. That aligns the needs of the individual and the company,” he said. our  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:57:16.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
