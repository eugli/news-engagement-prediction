Let's leave it'.\" \n\"We had a good look around at a few other models, as my wife's from a Cessna-based family, so going away from a Cessna is like changing your breed of cattle.\" \nMr Mashford's interest in learning to fly had been simmering for a long time. \n\"It's always been a bit of an interest,\" he said. \n\"We're just lucky enough to get into a position now with the place and stock numbers getting up. \n\"It makes it easier to manage rather than relying on more and more staff,\" he said. \n\"We can do a lot more in-house — that's definitely paid off. \n\"The way you manage a place changes a little bit too, as you've got a bird's eye view of anything. You can definitely keep a better eye on what's going on around you, which is great. \n\"And, like I said, I've always had an interest in flying and the timing was right for us to give it a go.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:17:26.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
