Her career was climbing substantially at the time she became pregnant (though the Fugees split that same year), and those around her suggested that an abortion might have been the right way to go.

I was like, ‘is Zion too much of a weight to carry?’ But this little boy, man. I would say he personally delivered me from my emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, I felt like I was born again.” \nHe was born in August 1997. Almost 20 years later, the child we sang about in “To Zion” is now a 19-year-old man — and a father.

While Hill, who has just welcomed her first grandchild, hasn’t said anything about the new addition to her family, Zion, his father, Rohan Marley, and sister Selah celebrated the birth on social media: A post shared by Zion David Marley (@ziontrainmarley) on Feb 20, 2017 at 9:47am PST A post shared by Rohan Marley (@romarley) on Feb 19, 2017 at 6:46am PST A post shared by Rohan Marley (@romarley) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:04pm PST A post shared by Selah (@selahmarley) on Feb 19, 2017 at 3:31pm PST \nAnybody else feel old? \nCongratulations to the entire family on their new blessing! Hill put it best when speaking about parenthood: \n“It’s extraordinary how these babies are created, and they come to us and through us,” she said in that same aforementioned VIBE interview. “It’s hard to put into words. Trust me when I say this, it is the highest form of unconditional love that you can ever feel.” Trending on MadameNoire Comment Disclaimer: Comments that contain profane or derogatory language, video links or exceed 200 words will require approval by a moderator before appearing in the comment section.
