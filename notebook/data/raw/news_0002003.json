The existing surcharge of 15% of tax on people earning more than Rs 1 crore will continue. This is likely to give additional revenue of Rs 2,700 crores. \nIn order to expand the tax net, the Finance Minister also said that a simple one page form to be filed as income tax return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto Rs 5 lakhs other than business income. \nAlso a person, who falls in this category and files income tax return for the first time, would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the department regarding his high value transaction. \nFollowing is the table of impact on individual on tax proposals: \nINCOME TAX RATE IMPACT \n-Up to Rs 2,50,000: NIL NIL \n-Rs 2,50,001 to Rs 5,00,000: 5% Rs 7,725 (Savings) Senior Citizens 60 years but less than 80 years \n-Up to Rs 3,00,000: NIL NIL \n-Rs 3,00,001 to Rs 5,00,000: 5% Rs 2,575 (Savings) \n-Rs 5,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000: 20% Rs 7,725 (Savings) Senior Citizens 80 years and above \n-Up to Rs 5,00,000: NIL NIL \n-Rs 5,00,001 to Rs 10,00,000: 20% Rs 7,725 (Savings) \nSurcharge of 10% on income of all individuals above Rs 50 lakh and less than Rs 1 crore and surcharge of 15 percent on income above Rs 1 crore ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:59:31.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
