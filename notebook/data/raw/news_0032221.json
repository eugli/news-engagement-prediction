Fiscal policy is set to remain accommodative, while improving financing conditions are set to contribute to the recovery in investment. \nThe current-account is forecast to stabilise at a surplus of over 5% of GDP. \nGiven Malta's high trade openness, shocks to global trade could have a disproportionate impact on the domestic economy, the commission said. \nThe successful launching of the Malta Development Bank could lead to more dynamic investment in the medium term. \nMeanwhile, effective implementation of ongoing structural reforms could boost domestic demand and further support growth prospects going forward. \nNet job creation in 2016 is expected to have been robust thanks at least in part to the implementation of activation policies by the government. It is forecast to have outpaced the expansion of the labour force, sending the unemployment rate to below 5%. \nUnemployment is set to remain broadly unchanged over the forecast horizon, close to the structural rate. Skills shortages are expected to put pressure on wage growth. \nWith productivity rising at the same time, however, unit labour cost increases are projected to remain contained. Skills shortages are expected to put pressure on wage growth \nConsumer price inflation moderated in 2016 in particular due to prices of recreation and cultural services. It is projected to pick up moderately over the forecast horizon but to remain below the long term average. \nBudget deficit broadly stable over the forecast horizon \nIn 2016, the general government deficit is estimated to have decreased to 0.7% of GDP, from 1.4% in 2015. Current revenue is expected to have grown more than nominal GDP, due to the favourable macroeconomic environment as well as the proceeds from the citizenship programme and the rise in excise duties. \nCurrent expenditure is expected to have continued growing, mainly driven by increases in public sector wages and intermediate consumption, which included costs associated with Malta’s presidency of the EU. \nDespite the sharp decline in the absorption of EU funds, due to the beginning of a new programming period, and a lower capital injection into the national airline, net capital expenditure is expected to increase by 0.2 pps. of GDP. \nIn 2017, the deficit is expected to decline marginally to 0.6% of GDP. \nDespite a boost to tax revenue by the introduction of revenue increasing measures in the 2017 budget, current revenue is expected to grow slower than nominal GDP due to lower proceeds from the citizenship scheme. \nCurrent expenditure growth is also expected to moderate, mainly thanks to lower interest expenditure and a more moderate increase in social spending. \nOn the contrary, higher intermediate consumption and other current expenditure are set to boost the growth rate of the total current expenditure. \nNet public investment is expected to decrease by 0.2 pps. of GDP due to greater implementation of investment projects co-financed by the EU. \nIn 2018, under a no-policy-change assumption, the deficit is expected to remain stable even as revenues linked to the citizenship programme continue to fall. \nPotential expenditure overruns could come from a renewal of the public sector wage agreement. \nThe structural deficit is projected to be on a declining path and to improve by more than 2 pps. of GDP by 2018. From 60.8% in 2015, the debt-toGDP ratio is projected to fall below 60% in 2016 and to reach 55.6% by 2018. « Malta is the seventh-best place in Europe for LGBT workers, report claims Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&amp;campaign=0&amp;cb=502464827&amp;n=d67bdea3' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&amp;campaign=0&amp;cb=502464827&amp;n=d67bdea3' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
