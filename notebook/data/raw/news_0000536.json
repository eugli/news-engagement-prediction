Leonard Fournette. (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:37 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:37 p.m. ET \nFormer LSU running back Leonard Fournette sparked a heated debate in the college football bowl season when it was announced he would not participate in the team's Dec. 31 Citrus Bowl matchup against Louisville. \nAre players who do this letting their team down? Should they consider their financial future in the NFL? Will pro teams look at their decision negatively? \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft 2017 \nWell, Fournette provided another talking point for the discussion on Friday when he told NFL Now Live that it wasn't his choice to sit out the bowl game. \n\"To be honest, it really wasn't my decision,\" Fournette said, via NFL.com . \"My coach brought me into the office. He told me 'You have a lot on the line.' He didn't want me to play. I cried like a baby. It was hard for me. That was my first time not really traveling with the team and I couldn't play in a game with my brothers. I'm going to miss them.\" \nAccording to NFL.com, Fournette reiterated that point, saying the decision had been made for him by the unnamed coach. \nMORE: Pros and cons of Fournette, Christian McCaffrey sitting out bowls \nFournette's decision to talk about the situation now — long after his decision was headline news — is puzzling. When the decision was originally announced, he seemed to accept responsibility for it. While he received some criticism, many argued he was more than justified in looking out for himself, especially after he dealt with a nagging ankle injury throughout his junior season. \nBut Fournette has shifted responsibility for the decision from himself to a team he no longer plays for, and that will only give NFL teams something else to ask about in their respective interviews. The decision was no longer news: Why change his tune now? \nEven if Fournette didn't mean anything by the comment, it could raise concerns (however unlikely) that he'd be willing to place blame on future NFL teams. At the very least, they'll ask him why he thought it was necessary to change his story at all.
