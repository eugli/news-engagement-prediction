Last June, he spent nearly two weeks, again in London, for treatment for an ear infection.\nThe trip to the UK appears to roll back on the commitment to tighten up on government officials seeking medical attention abroad.\nSpeaking on the president's behalf at last year's Nigeria Medical Association General Conference (NMA) in Sokoto, Health Minister Isaac ‎Adewole said the Buhari administration would not encourage spending Nigeria's hard earned resources on any government official seeking medical care abroad, especially when there was evidence of expertise in Nigeria.\nThe president has been heavily criticised for seeming to renege on his promise to restrict \"medical tourism\".\nAfter the first visit to London, leading Nigerian doctor Osahon Enabulele, vice-president of the Commonwealth Medical Association, said it was a \"national shame\" that Mr Buhari went to the UK for treatment when Nigeria had more than 250 ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists, as well as a National Ear Centre.\nHe said also that Mr Buhari should lead by example in using Nigerian doctors and facilities, and ensure government officials do not go abroad on \"frivolous\" medical trips.\nIn the past, President Buhari has said that Nigeria loses about $1bn a year to medical tourism.\nSome Nigerians have turned to Twitter to comment on what they see as \"double standards\":", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/169B8/production/_94000629_tweet1a.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-africa-38235321", "http://healthreporters.info/2016/04/27/nigeria-lost-1b-to-medical-tourism-buhari/", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CD78/production/_94000625_femitripp.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5423/production/_93993512_buhariafa.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36468154"], "published": "2017-02-06T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:33:30.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
