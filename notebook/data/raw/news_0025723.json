( Johnny Vy/CBS via AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — At Sunday's Grammys, a man and a transgender woman will join the so-called trophy girls who bring music's top honors onstage.\nIt's a change that puts the Grammys in the front ranks of awards diversity.\nChanging up the Grammy trophy presenters isn't window-dressing. The awards increasingly have honored a variety of artists in different genres, from rap to country to jazz to classical, with Beyonce and Adele among the top contenders this time around.\nThe three trophy handlers at Sunday's ceremony are transgender model Martina Robledo; model and actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. The ceremony airs live on CBS from 8-11 p.m. EST with James Corden as host.\nClick to expand Replay Video Beyoncé And Adele Will Duel For Top Diva At The Grammys The two musicians will compete against each other for album, song and record of the year at the 59th annual Grammy Awards. Newsy A preview Of The 2017 Grammy's Awards: Beyoncé Vs. Adele And More This year, James Corden will host. LL Cool J is out after hosting for five straight years. Grammy ratings among young viewers slipped in his last year. This year’s Grammys feature a battle of the divas Adele and Beyonce. In a face-off for the ages, they are competing for: Album of the year, Record of the year and Song of the year. After the drama of Beyonce losing Album of the Year in 2015 to Beck, many are betting on Queen Bey. After dramatically interrupting Beck at the 2015 Grammys, and Taylor Swift at the Music Video Awards in 2009, Kanye Swift claims he won’t attend this year’s Grammys. Drake and Justin Bieber are also skipping out despite nominations. Chance the Rapper, and the Chainsmokers, are considered frontrunners for Best New Artist. This year’s Grammys will feature performances by Bruno Mars, Adele, John Legend, Metallica, Carrie Underwood and more. Who are you betting on?
