Yes those qualities can be found in my boyfriend. \nSo what is bothering me now? One particular fact is that my boyfriend is not a combat fit ns guy( Meaning that he is just a 8-5 clerk) last time as compared to other combat fit males who are yet shorter and looks weaker. However, I have tried closing one eye regarding this. \nWhat makes me really furious is the fact that he behaves like some ah gua. I remember that there was one incident where some girls hurled verbal insults at me. Instead of protecting me, he sat at a corner and cowered in fear. What a useless guy! The girls even proceeded to bully him after they had enough of me, leaving him in tears?!! What? Such a big guy yet so weak on the inside! It was so embarassing. \nIf my boyfriend cant even protect himself from nasty gals, how can I rely on him to protect me from guys? This is such a headache. Sometimes having those tall rich handsome qualities are pretty useless. Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
