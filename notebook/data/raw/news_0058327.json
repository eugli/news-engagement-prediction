Senator Hanson believes Australia should have zero net migration, a view shared by millionaire entrepreneur Dick Smith, who threw his support behind One Nation in December. The Queensland senator said high migration levels would threaten Australia's way of life 'I believe that we should have a zero net. So if we have 80-100,000 Australian leave our shores every year, replace those,' she said. Former Labor foreign minister and NSW premier Bob Carr and former federal Labor MP Kelvin Thomson have also previously called migration levels to be cut back, as Australia's population climbs above 24 million. Senator Hanson's broadcast got mixed reviews from her followers. 'Well done Pauline! I love your passion about Australia,' one said. Pauline Hanson was asked online about his first husband who was a Polish migrant 'Fantastic broadcast, love the view. Thank you for sharing Pauline,' another said. But others were not so quick to compliment the Queensland senator. 'You should be discussing why your party's candidates are all such vile people,' one man said. 'Any chance you'll talk about some of your racist candidates?' another said. One person brought up her ex-partner, Walter Zagorski, who was a Polish migrant: 'Wasn't your first husband an immigrant?' Senator Hanson's broadcast follows on from Mr Smith telling Sky News Australia's high migration levels were to blame for driving up house prices. Mr Smith, a zero net population growth advocate, said Australia's housing affordability crisis was the fault of 'ridiculous' immigrant numbers. Pauline Hanson's wants Australia to have a zero migration policy to preserve our way of life Entrepreneur Dick Smith threw his support behind Pauline Hanson in December over her zero net migration policy. He told Sky News high migration made houses unaffordable The former electronics chain founder and helicopter enthusiast said young people would no longer be able to afford a house as prices in capital cities skyrocketed by hundreds of dollars a day. 'A lot of our problems are from this unbelievable population increase,' he said on Tuesday night. Sydney has a median house price of $1.1 million, making it the second most expensive housing market in the world after Hong Kong. An Australian worker on an average full-time salary of $78,832 is unable to afford a house in Sydney unless they are prepared to live at Mount Druitt, 43 kilometres west of the city, where homes sell for $600,000. Under former prime minister John Howard, Australia's net annual migration level jumped from 100,000 in 2004 to more than 200,000.
