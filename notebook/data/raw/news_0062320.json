Stacey turned up wearing the same makeup as the night before (Photo: ITV) She'd lost her backpack on the red carpet (Photo: Lia Toby/WENN) She was also wearing slippers! (Photo: ITV) \n\"I'd walked with this backpack, filled with all my clothes, down the red carpet like a geek, but then I took it off and no one could find it.\" \n\"I thought 'I'll get it tomorrow', but it wasn't there!\" \nStacey then revealed she'd asked Joe if she could borrow his jeans and t-shirt, but he refused! \nShe said: \"He gave me his jacket and kicked me out of the car! \n\"I couldn't wear my top because it smelt of B.O.!\" Viewers were in disbelief (Photo: ITV) She still looked so good! (Photo: ITV) \nDespite insisting she'd showered, Stacey then confessed she was wearing the same makeup as the night before. \nBut Loose Women viewers were in disbelief at Stacey, due to how good she looked! \nOne said: \"There's no chance @StaceySolomon slept in that make up.\" \nAnother added: \"Yes what a pretty tall tale...thought panelists were dressed by the loosewomen wardrobe team!\" \n*Loose Women continues on ITV1 weekdays at 12.30pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:29:20.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
