So far, we have established that she was involved somehow with sinister Nathan and that she somehow knows the late Kylie Platt. \nNow it seems like she has been a mother at some point as she secretly gazed at a photo of a young child while in the cafe. Gail Rodwell had accused Shona of stealing her purse so Shona was forced to empty her handbag. But before she did, she quickly swiped out her crumpled photograph, only looking at it when everyone had gone. \nBut who is the child in the photograph? Is it a child that Shona tragically lost? Is it a a child she gave up for adoption? Might they be someone on the Street and could there be a connection between the child and Kylie? \nThere are a lot of questions still to answer but it’s clear that viewers might be in for a shock down the line as more emerges about Shona. \nAnd when she gets closer to Gail and the Platts, might they be the ones to discover the truth?
