Mike Steele - I love live music and watching hockey. Been a Steelers fan since birth! Lived in the South Hills a good part of my life. Mom & Dad have been married 50 years. I have two amazing sisters and I'm a proud uncle, too. This is my 2nd tenure at the studios - I did weekends at WDVE in the 1990's. After working in Austin, Texas for eight years, I returned to my hometown. Happy to be back in the Burgh!
