Male birth control Image copyright SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption A vasectomy is designed to be permanent, although some men have successfully had the operation reversed \nAt the moment, men have two main options of contraceptive: wear a condom to catch the sperm have a sterilising operation (vasectomy) to cut or seal the two tubes that carry sperm to the penis from where they are made in the testicles \nVasalgel has the same end effect as vasectomy, but researchers hope it should be easier to reverse if a man later decides he wants to have children. \nIn theory, another injection should dissolve the gel plug. \nThat worked in early tests in rabbits, but the researchers have yet to prove the same in monkeys and man. \nThe idea behind Vasalgel is not new. \nAnother experimental male birth control gel - RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) - that works in a similar way to Vasalgel is being tested in men in India. \nUnlike RISUG, Vasalgel is not designed to impair the swimming sperm. \nIt merely blocks their path while still letting other fluid through, according to the manufacturer. \nBoth gels are given as an injection, under anaesthetic, and are meant to offer long-acting contraception. The monkey trial \nThe University of California researchers tested the gel on 16 adult male monkeys. \nTen of the monkeys were already fathers. \nThe monkeys were monitored for a week after getting the injection and were then released back into their an enclosure to rejoin some fertile females. \nMating did occur, but none of the female monkeys became pregnant over the course of the study, which included two full breeding periods for some of the animals. \nFew of the male monkeys had side-effects, although one did need an operation because the injection did not go to plan and damaged one of his tubes. Image copyright California National Primate Research Centreâ€™ Image caption None of the male monkeys in the gel trial went on to father offspring \nAllan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: \"The study shows that, in adult male monkeys at least, the gel is an effective form of contraception. \n\"But in order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible.\" \nHe said there had been very little commercial interest from pharmaceutical companies in this kind of a approach. \nThe non-profit company researching Vasalgel, the Parsemus Foundation, has used grants and fundraising to get this far. \nProf Pacey said: \"The idea of a social venture company to develop the idea is intriguing. \n\"I would imagine there is a worldwide market for a new male contraceptive, but trials in humans and more long-term safety data are required before we will know if it is a success.\" \nThis type of contraceptive wouldn't protect against sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. Condoms are still needed for that. \nIn terms of willingness, experts believe men would be up for trying new contraceptives, such as a gel. \nDr Anatole Menon-Johansson of the sexual health charity Brook said: \"Some men do want to be part of the solution and do their part. \n\"If you can have more options available then maybe more men would go for it.\" \nHe said a the idea of a \"reversible vasectomy\" was desirable, where as asking some men to take hormones to control their fertility might be \"a big ask\".
