Watch in Times Video » embed Off the coast of the island of Hawaii, lava is flowing into the ocean like blood from a ruptured artery. From the Kilauea volcano ’s Kamokuna ocean entry, it hits the salty water and explodes. Molten rock shoots upward and outward. A steamy cloud of acid rises from below. Beneath the ocean’s surface, lava cools. Rubble forms. Normally it stacks up, creating a rocky shelf on which the lava settles: a lava delta. But this time, the flow has continued to gush nearly 100 feet down, into the sea, for a whole month. This same volcano has sent lava traveling through tubes from moving vents along its eastern r ift z one, Pu’ u O ’o , ever since it erupted 34 years ago. And these tubes have carried it to a number of spots along the ocean. But such streams usually last just a day or two; this one has been going since New Year’s Eve, when 21 acres of lava delta collapsed into the ocean, exposing the tube. “The only thing we can surmise is the offshore topography apparently is so steep that, as the lava is flowing in and forming all this new rubble, it’s just slipping down into deeper parts of the ocean and not piling up to form a new delta,” said Janet Babb , a geologist at the United States Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory , who monitors the volcano. “Lava will continue to flow into the ocean until it’s disrupted.” That means the supply must be cut, either from the source, or by a large earthquake that would crimp or collapse the tubes that are carrying it from the vent to the ocean. As the flow continues, visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park have to keep their distance. Photo A new lava delta cannot yet form, allowing the lava stream to continue flowing.

Last May, a new vent broke out on Pu’u O’o. Lava started flowing and moving south toward the coast. As the lava moved, the part touching the air cooled and crusted over, resulting in lava tubes that made its passage to the ocean far more efficient, just as veins channel blood. The tubes from this volcano range in diameter: so fat that a bus could pass through, so skinny that a human couldn’t. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The lava traveled seven miles down these tubes, and by July 26 it had reached the ocean. At the time, that was big news, Ms. Babb said, because that was the first ocean entry since 2013. When hot lava hits salty water it results in a chemical explosion. Rubble forms, stacking up, and lava mounds up over it, creating a lava delta. Over about four months, between July and December, this lava built a 24-acre delta. “Lava deltas are inherently unstable because they’re built on a foundation of rubble,” Ms. Babb said. Indeed, they noticed cracks developing in the delta. “On New Year’s Eve the inevitable happened. The lava delta collapsed,” she said. Four acres of sea cliff beside the delta and near an area that can get thousands of daily visitors also crumbled into the ocean below. Photo The plume when lava hits the ocean is “a superheated steam laced with hydrochloric acid,” said Janet Babb, a geologist.

The lava is now flowing from an exposed tube resting some 20 feet below the cliff’s surface. There is no sign that a new delta is forming, or that the flow will stop. “Until it starts piling up to form a new delta, this is what we have,” Ms. Babb said.
