(AP) By Adam Berry / MLB.com | @adamdberry | + 0 COMMENTS \nDUNEDIN, Fla. -- Before Monday, Pirates manager Clint Hurdle had only seen right-hander Clay Holmes on video or throwing to his own teammates in Spring Training. \nHolmes left a pretty good first impression in his Grapefruit League debut, tossing two scoreless innings and striking out four in the Pirates' 2-1 win over the Blue Jays at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium. The 6-foot-5 right-hander touched 97 mph with his fastball, mixed in his relatively new slider-cutter and tossed a few curveballs while holding Toronto to one hit and a walk. \n• Spring: Tickets | Ballpark | 40-man roster | NRIs \n\"The fastball's real with some life,\" Hurdle said. \"You saw downhill angle, extreme downhill angle.\" \nThe Pirates added Holmes, their No. 11 prospect according to MLBPipeline.com, to their 40-man roster in November to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft. The 23-year-old underwent Tommy John surgery in 2014, sat out most of 2015 and returned to pitch for Double-A Altoona last season. \nHolmes finished 10-9 with a 4.22 ERA in 136 1/3 innings over 26 starts. He experienced the inconsistency that often follows Tommy John returnees in their first year back but found a comfort zone toward the end of the season. \n\"Getting back to that spot as quick as I can here in Spring Training has kind of been my goal,\" Holmes said. \"That first year back, you have your peaks and valleys. When I picked up a ball this offseason, I finally started to feel like I could be athletic with my arm.\" \nHolmes is at least a year away from making a run at the Pirates rotation, but it's not difficult to see why Pittsburgh values him. He showed it Monday. He fits their preferred profile as a big, hard-throwing right-handed starter who pounds the bottom of the strike zone. \n\"I felt great today. There was definitely some adrenaline and excitement being out there,\" Holmes said. \"I feel like I handled that well and still stayed within myself and executed some pitches.\" \nAround the horn • Tyler Glasnow 's dominant two-inning stint Sunday was the talk of Pirates camp on Monday. Tony Watson was pleased to hear Glasnow effectively used the slide-step he picked up from the closer -- the one Watson once learned from former Pirates closer Jason Grilli and bullpen coach Euclides Rojas.
