The MoD has got its priorities completely wrong. We should be focusing on those troops who are fully committed to service, not those looking for a part-time job.’ Details of the Flexible Duties Trial are contained in a high-level MoD document obtained by The Mail on Sunday. The dossier reveals that troops will be able to ‘reduce their liability to deploy’ to war zones for up to two years. It says: ‘All types of flexible duty will be subject to a 24-month trial involving applicants in order to test the arrangements and the processes necessary to deliver them. It is open to all personnel serving in the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel. Service personnel will be allowed to reduce their liability to be deployed.’ In a move that could potentially save the MoD millions, soldiers who choose to take easier terms will lose out on tax-free bonuses of up to £50 per day on top of their regular wages Last night, the MoD said that troops who signed up to the deal could still be forced to fight in extreme circumstances. The bombshell document also reveals troops will be able to take up to 93 days unpaid leave over the course of a year – effectively allowing them to work just a three-day week and seek employment outside the military on their days off. It says: ‘This results in an individual being able to work less than five days a week, although still liable for evening and weekend duties on paid days. This also limits an individual’s liability to deploy, on the basis that a requirement to deploy would require full-time working.’ Defence experts fear this move could allow troops to avoid going to war altogether and undermine the capacity of the British Armed Forces - although MoD says they could still be called up under 'exceptional circumstances' No cap has been put on the numbers of Service personnel across the Armed Forces who can take up these options. Instead, senior officers may approve as many requests from troops for flexible duties as they wish, so long as their units retain ‘operational effectiveness’. Even Special Forces officers and commanders of key units across the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force could be granted approval to avoid war-zone service and adopt flexi-time working arrangements. Last night, the MoD insisted measures will be put in place to maintain the fighting capability of these key units. Suitable replacements for those seeking flexible duties would be found. Only then would the troops on the controversial scheme be moved to less important jobs, such the administration department of regimental headquarters. The trial has started at a time when Britain’s Armed Forces are shrinking by the day, raising fears that operational effectiveness and readiness to deploy to war zones will be adversely affected. The documents reveal that troops will be allowed up to 93 days unpaid leave over the course of a year – effectively allowing them to work just a three-day week and seek employment outside the military on their days off The regular Army is at its smallest size since the Napoleonic Wars – just 76,260 fully trained soldiers, according to official figures – while the Royal Navy does not have enough sailors to man its fleet, including its new £6.2 billion aircraft carriers. More people also left the Armed Forces last year than signed up to start military training. While the trial will save the MoD money in wages and bonuses to troops on the frontline, defence insiders insist it is intended to solve family issues such as troops spending too much time apart from their partners and children. Last night, one serving officer argued that such radical changes to the working practices of the Armed Forces were required to stem the tide of experienced and skilled personnel who are leaving the Services every year. He said: ‘If this scheme works, it will be immeasurably beneficial to the Armed Forces. We’re losing so many good people who would stay in if a bit of leeway and common sense was applied to their working arrangements. The tempo of operations and readiness targets are lower today than during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘So commanders can look ahead over the next 24 months and see who they really need to keep on the permanent staff and who can take a back seat for a while. If giving somebody a couple of years off operational commitments means they stay in the Armed Forces and are refreshed and fully charged again, that can only be good. ‘I just hope it is offered to the people who really need it most.’ The plan has been signed off by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nick Carter. They hope the trial will appeal to female personnel who consider military life with its rigid hours and lengthy overseas commitments to be entirely incompatible with raising a family. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night: ‘This pilot is part of a modern offer to help Britain’s world-class Armed Forces keep the broadest range of people and give them and their families the broadest service opportunities.’ COLONEL RICHARD KEMP: The next step is an Army that's not able to deploy after 5pm This ill-considered, headline-chasing policy will turn our Armed Forces into a semi-reserve force. If we’re not careful the next step will be an Army that can’t deploy after 5pm, or isn’t available at weekends. Everyone has to realise that joining the Army, the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force is not just another job and I am afraid to say it cannot be a family-friendly organisation. That is the unpleasant reality of Service life.One must ask the question: Do we really want to have soldiers whose priority is not to serve? Or whose priority is to go off and do other things for a couple of days a week? Our Armed Forces are of such high quality because of the extraordinary commitment made by our people. We do not want to encourage them to reduce that level of service, or prioritise the interests of those who are not as driven to succeed as military personnel. Also, to achieve cohesion among fighting units, which is critical to success, troops must live and train together and make the same sacrifices. Allowing some people to avoid going anywhere where they might be shot at isn’t conducive to this aim. Rather, fighting capability will be reduced and so will the readiness of our Services to deploy to where British interests are being challenged. The Flexible Duties Trial is taking us down the same route as various European armies. To them, being in the armed forces is just another job, with the same obligations and rights as civilian employment. But recruits to the British Armed Forces must continue to understand that by enlisting they are making a major commitment, beyond that of any other job. This strikes me as a panic move by politicians and Service chiefs to deal with recruitment and retention problems of their own making. Recruitment isn’t done properly because it has been outsourced while mismanagement and legal attacks on our troops have made retention of high-quality individuals more difficult.

How 34 troops across the Armed Forces are having medical treatment to change their gender Thirty-four troops across the Armed Forces are having medical treatment to change gender, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The figure has emerged for the first time after a Freedom of Information request to the Ministry of Defence’s Surgeon General Secretariat. The treatment is available on the NHS and may be limited to hormone therapy for some patients, while others will undergo surgery costing at least £20,000 in each case. Thirty-four troops across the Armed forces are undergoing medical treatment to reassign their gender, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. Hannah Winterbourne, 27, (pictured) became Britain's first transgender officer after she began her transition in 2013 It is not known whether the troops are being treated at public expense or from their own pockets. Last year, Guardsman Chloe Allen became Britain’s first female infantry soldier when she started gender reassignment treatment and changed her name. She joined up in 2012 as a man. Guardsman Allen of the 1st Battalion, the Scots Guards, is understood to be one of the 34 troops who recently started hormone therapy. Should she deploy to a war zone, the soldier from Cumbria will also become the first woman allowed to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. In 2015, Captain Hannah Winterbourne became the Army’s most highly ranked transgender soldier and the first to become an officer. Captain Winterbourne, 29, who had previously completed an operational tour of Afghanistan as a man, is now one of the leading officers in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. She has said: ‘In Afghanistan, I was acting for everyone around me. I was sharing a tent with seven men and I realised I could not go on as things were.’ The number of troops who have already completed transgender treatment – before or after joining up – has not been revealed. An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘We seek to recruit and retain talented personnel regardless of gender identity.’ How the Royal Navy is all at sea over an appeal to ancient mariners to crew its new £6.2 billion aircraft carriers Britain’s two new £6.2 billion aircraft carriers have been heralded as the beginning of an exciting era in naval warfare – but due to a manpower crisis, they will be crewed by some of the saltiest sea dogs of modern times. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that this week the Ministry of Defence will begin a recruitment drive begging ex-sailors who have retired or been made redundant to come back to man the ships. Normally, only sailors aged up to 59 are considered for duty. But a shortage of personnel has led naval chiefs to appeal to mariners aged 60 and above to apply for key posts. Admirals have also been forced to waive rules which say that applicants for top jobs must have served in the Royal Navy in the past five years – intended to ensure their skills are up to date. Britain’s two new £6.2 billion aircraft carriers could be crewed by sailors aged over 59 because of a manpower shortage, after a failed recruitment drive in 2015 saw only a few hundred sailors brought in Such is the severity of the manpower shortage that applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis, irrespective of how long ago they last went to sea. Sailors paid off by the MoD as part of various redundancy programmes are also being invited to apply for jobs on the new aircraft carriers and across the Royal Navy fleet. The old sea dogs are being enticed with five-year contracts under the Royal Navy’s Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) scheme. In 2015, the Royal Navy asked the MoD to provide 4,000 additional personnel but only a few hundred sailors were brought in. As of January 1 this year, the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines had 29,190 personnel – down from 29,530 in 2016 and ten per cent less than their operational requirement. At 920ft long and displacing 65,000 tons, the new carriers are the largest British warships ever built. Each will carry 40 aircraft and will be crewed by 700 sailors and officers. Each carrier is the height of a 12-storey block of flats. HMS Queen Elizabeth is due to start sea trials this summer, with sister ship HMS Prince of Wales following a year later. The final piece of construction on the Queen Elizabeth will be the fitting of her 25ft-wide propellers by divers at the Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. A Navy spokesman said: ‘We are gauging interest in Reserve service across the fleet. Specific requirements have yet to be determined but all are welcome to apply.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:42:06.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
