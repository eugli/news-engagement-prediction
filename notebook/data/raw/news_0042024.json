IfeanyiUbah FC \n“We heard that the weather this time in Egypt is very cold so we are trying to get there on time for the players to adapt to the climate there,” Dr. Ubah said. \nHe expressed confidence that the Anambra Warriors will prevail over the Egyptians despite the slim win in the first leg. \n“We played far much better than them. We dominated the game like 85% possession. We created a lot of chances and missed no fewer than six scoring chances. \n“Essentially, they were kept in the game by their goalkeeper. They played more defensively. But I know that in the return leg, the game will be open because they will come out for goals and that will make the game open”. \nThe club management revealed that a strong 75-ma supporter’s contingent accompanied the team to Egypt. \nThe contingent departed Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos at 1pm yesterday and were scheduled to arrive Egypt at about 5pm (Nigerian time).
