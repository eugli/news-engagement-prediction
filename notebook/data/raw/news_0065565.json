Sources said he asked both the DGPs to ensure law and order “at any cost”. \nAlso read | INLD threat to dig up SYL canal: Amarinder urges Centre to deploy armed forces \nIt was Kumar who had prepared the status report of MHA on the SYL issue, which was submitted in the Supreme Court after the Punjab assembly passed the controversial bill to return land to farmers. The apex court had then ordered to maintain status quo on the issue. \nAlso read | Punjab refuses to budge, says cannot recover SYL land returned to farmers \nPUNJAB TAKING NO CHANCES \nMeanwhile, a wary Punjab is taking no chances and fortified its borders with Haryana to stop the INLD from entering the state. \nThe state government has deployed more than 5,000 security men, besides 10 battalions of the paramilitary forces, on various entry points of Punjab in Patiala district. \nAlso read | Barricades up, drones in the air, border with Haryana fortified to avert SYL face-off \nCCTV cameras have been installed, steel walls erected, barbed-wired fencing put up in the fields alongside the Haryana border. A helicopter is being used to conduct aerial surveillance. A mock drill was also conducted to check the preparedness. \nPolice sources said the GT Road entry point will be sealed on Thursday morning, while heavy police deployment has already been made at Kapuri village in Patiala — the place where the foundation stone of the SYL canal was laid in 1982 — and other embankments of the canal. The government has barricaded roads, brick-walled bridges and deployed around 2,000 security personnel.

Forces have been deployed to tackle any situation.” \nDGP (law and order) Hardeep Dhillon and IG (Patiala range) B Chander Sekhar are camping in the transit control room set up at Shambu. SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS Over 5,000 cops deployed, besides 10 battalions of CRPF Helicopter is being used to conduct aerial surveillance Anti-riot squads, water cannons, tear gas firing squads, horse squad deployed Steel barriers kept ready at Shambu border, which will be placed on the road on Thursday morning to stop any traffic, which will be diverted from Sirhind towards Chandigarh road to reach Ambala. Section 144 CrPC imposed on Patiala district \nThe police have also decided not to allow All India Sikh Students Federation activists to reach at Kapuri or Shambu. The AISSF had announced to stop INLD workers from entering Punjab. \nAfter his meeting with MHA official, Haryana DGP KP Singh visited the Shambhu barrier, the main entry point of Punjab from Haryana. He took stock of the situation and assured all assistance to Punjab in maintaining law and order. \nHaryana has also increased its police strength at Shambhu in the wake of MHA’s intervention. \nThe DGP also visited the vegetable market at Ambala, where INLD workers will converge on Thursday before moving towards Punjab for digging of SYL. The site is around two km from the Punjab border. \nPUNJAB POLICE NOT RELYING ON HARYANA \nPunjab Police sources said the political compulsions of the BJP government in Haryana won’t allow it to stop INLD as any action against the party over the SYL issue can cause political damage to the saffron party. Therefore, Punjab is taking extra precautions. Police officials have been directed to use heavy force if INLD workers try to cross into the Punjab territory. \nA senior Punjab police official said, “Even as the Haryana Police have assured full support, Punjab cant’ bank upon them. We are preparing as per our own plan as we know even a single incident will have dangerous cascading effect on Punjab’s law and order, as SYL is an emotive issue in Punjab”. \nHe said if the INLD wants to lodge a peaceful protest at Shambhu, the police have earmarked a place for it. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:14:52.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
