They are waiting for a report from OH&S. \nThe couple described their son as a good brother who loved snowboarding, motorcycles, fishing and hanging out with his friends. \n“He was a good guy, a good worker. He was always there to lend a hand,” Carol said. \nJesse was also a new uncle, with twin nephews born just 8 weeks ago. \n“He was pretty proud of those two little boys,” Carol said. \nThe family said they are still in shock. \n“You never want to be burying your children.
