And it's one of the best showings of all time for when the sweethearts' holiday falls on a weekday, almost matching record-holder The Vow , which pulled in $11.5 million on Valentine's Day in 2012, also a Tuesday. \nFrom Universal and based on E.L. James' S&M book series, Fifty Shades Darker has earned $61.5 million in its first five days, slightly ahead of the $60.8 million grossed by Warner Bros.' Lego Batman (both films debuted in North America on Feb. 10). \nFifty Shades Darker , however, continues to pace behind Fifty Shades of Grey , which earned $98.5 million in its first five days. The first film had the advantage of opening of opening over Presidents Day weekend in 2014, when Valentine's Day fell on a Saturday. \nUniversal is counting on Fifty Shades Darker on being a slower burn than Fifty Shades of Grey , which dropped a steep 74 percent in its second weekend. \nLionsgate also touted La La Land as a Valentine's Day destination. The movie placed No. 6 with $1.5 million, a big jump over the $522,534 earned on Monday. The Oscar front-runner has earned nearly $128 million domestically and north of $300 million worldwide. \nGenerally speaking, a number of films saw a boost. John Wick: Chapter 2 placed No. 3 behind Fifty Shades and Lego Batman with 4.8 million for a five-day domestic total of $37.9 million. M. Night Syhamalan's Split followed with $2 million for a domestic total of $115.2, while box-office hit Hidden Figures rounded out the top five with $1.6 million for a total $133.8 million in North America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:46:59.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
