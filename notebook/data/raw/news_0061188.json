Staff writers, FOX SPORTS February 23, 2017 11:12am \nAUSTRALIA’S 16-man touring squad has played a combined 16 Tests in India. \nSteve Smith’s men will look to become just the second Australian touring party in 47 years to win a series in India — and they will do so with one of the least experienced squads sent to the subcontinent. \nNo current Australian player has experienced anything other than Test defeat in India — coach Darren Lehman was a player when Australia last won a match — and Shaun Marsh is the only batsman to score an international century there, albeit in an ODI. \nWe look at each Australian player’s formguide in India as the tourists aim to break an 11 Test sequence that has resulted in nine defeats, two draws and back-to-back series whitewashes. THE LEADERS \nCareer: 50 Tests, 4752 runs at 60.15 In India: 2 Tests, 161 runs at 40.25 \nSmith ended a 50-month exile from the Test squad in Mohali in 2013. He top scored among the recognised batsmen with 92 in the first innings and followed up with the handy wicket of Sachin Tendulkar for 37. Despite playing only half the Tests, Smith finished as Australia’s fourth highest run-scorer on tour. Not surprisingly, he retained his place in the squad for the ensuring Ashes tour. \nIn addition to his two Test matches, Smith has played five ODIs and four T20Is in India. He has also represented four different Indian Premier League franchises. \nDAVID WARNER (VC) \nCareer: 60 Tests, 5261 runs at 49.16 In India: 4 Tests, 195 runs at 24.37 media_camera SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — JANUARY 07: David Warner of Australia fields during day five of the Third Test match between Australia and Pakistan at Sydney Cricket Ground on January 7, 2017 in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by Cameron Spencer/Getty Images) \nWarner possesses vast limited overs experience in Indian conditions — indeed, he captained Sunrisers Hyderabad to the Indian Premier League title last year — and has played more Tests in India than any other member of the current squad. \nWarner was a member of the Australian touring party whitewashed 4-0 in India in 2013. And while he managed two half centuries — the equal best among Australian batsmen on that particular tour — he was dismissed four times for single-digit totals. THE BATSMEN \nCareer: 23 Tests, 1726 runs at 47.94 In India: N/A \nKhawaja can only hope this Test tour of India exceeds his previous visit. The “spare batsman” on tour was not spared the wrath of then-coach Mickey Arthur or captain Michael Clarke when he was sanctioned alongside three other teammates for his role in the infamous Homework-gate controversy. \nKhawaja has played three first class games in India against India A in 2013 and 2015 for a highest score of 41 not out. He also played four List A matches in 2015, six Indian Premier League games for the Rising Pune Supergiants last year and scored 56 runs at 14 at U19 ODI level. Internationally, Khawaja has scored 143 runs at 35.75 in four T20Is in India. \nMATT RENSHAW \nCareer: 4 Tests, 315 runs at 63.00 In India: N/A \nRenshaw hasn’t played much cricket generally, much less in Asia. He toured the UAE with the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers in 2014. And he scored 101 runs at 25.25 in four U19 ODIs that same season. \nWhether selectors reward his form from the SCG or opt for the more senior Shaun Marsh for the first Test in Pune on February 23 will make for fascinating viewing. \nPETER HANDSCOMB \nCareer: 4 Tests, 399 runs at 99.75 In India: N/A \nHandscomb started strongly with an innings of 91 in Australia A’s two-game four-day series against India A in Chennai two years ago, only to follow with successive ducks. He also scored 75 runs at 35.50 in three 50-over games from Australia A on the same tour. \nHandscomb represented Rising Pune Supergiants — where the first Test will be staged — under the captaincy of Steve Smith in 2016. He batted only once and was dismissed for six by Harbhajan Singh. \nSHAUN MARSH \nCareer: 19 Tests, 1325 runs at 40.15 In India: N/A \nMarsh’s red ball resume in India is thin, but he does boast two centuries and an average of 78.80 in neighbouring Sri Lanka. He has scored 144 runs at 28.80 from five one-day internationals, including a run-a-ball century in Hyderabad in 2009. He is the only Australian in this Test squad with an international century in India. \nMarsh is the 22nd highest run-scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League with 2213 runs at 40.98. He was the league’s highest run-scorer in 2008. THE KEEPER \nMATT WADE \nCareer: 16 Tests, 673 runs at 30.59 ... 47 catches, 4 stumpings In India: 3 Tests, 113 runs at 18.83 ... 4 catches, 1 stumping \nWade played three of the four Tests on Australia’s last tour of India — he was replaced by Brad Haddin for the third Test after spraining his ankle playing basketball — and was cast into Test exile immediately afterwards. \nAn innings of 62 in Hyderabad was the highlight, but Wade’s inconsistency with the gloves ultimately prompted selectors to cut him adrift after the Delhi Test. He was not recalled until the Adelaide Test this summer at the expense of Peter Nevill. THE ALL-ROUNDERS \nCareer: 19 Tests, 626 runs at 23.18 ... 29 wickets at 37.27 In India: N/A \nMarsh’s experience in India is of the 20-over variety. He has scored 30 runs and taken a wicket in two T20 internationals in India and played 20 matches in the Indian Premier League for the Deccan Charges, Pune Warriors and Pune Rising Supergiants between 2010 and 2016. \nHe has reclaimed his place in the Test squad at the expense of the incumbent all-rounder Hilton Cartwright due to his superior bowling. That facet of his game could be relied upon heavily as Australia look for seam bowling support and the flexibility to select more than one spinner in their Test XIs. \nGLENN MAXWELL \nCareer: 3 Tests, 80 runs at 13.33 ... 7 wickets at 38.71 In India: 2 Tests, 39 runs at 9.75 ... 7 wickets at 27.57 \nMaxwell has the rare distinction of opening both the batting and the bowling in a Test match. The second innings in Delhi in 2013, unfortunately, wasn’t particularly convincing as India romped to a six-wicket victory to seal a 4-0 series sweep. \nMaxwell has fared better in the limited overs arena in India with 248 runs at 41.33 and 136 runs at 27.20 in ODIs and T20Is respectively. But it is in the Indian Premier League where he has made his name — and many millions of dollars — representing the Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab in 43 matches between 2012 and 2016. \nASHTON AGAR \nCareer: 2 Tests, 130 runs at 32.50 ... 2 wickets at 124.00 In India: N/A \nAgar’s only international outing in India was a forgettable affair. He conceded 0-18 off one over and was dismissed for nine against New Zealand during the World T20 in Dharamsala last year. \nHe has taken six wickets in two first class games against India A in Chennai in 2013 and 2015. Agar has also played four List A games for Australia A in India, as well as representing the Perth Scorchers eight times in the now defunct T20 Champions League in India in 2013. THE SPINNERS \nCareer: 63 Tests, 228 wickets at 34.07 In India: 3 Tests, 15 wickets at 37.33 media_camera Australia's Nathan Lyon. \nLyon was controversially omitted from the second Test on the 2013 tour of India. His return of 3-215 in the first innings in Chennai came at an economy rate of 4.57, with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar (81), Virat Kohli (107) and MS Dhoni (224) launching him for a combined 18 fours and seven sixes. \nLyon was recalled for the third Test after the spin duo of Xavier Doherty and Glenn Maxwell failed to make significant inroads. He collected career best figures of 7-94 in the first innings of the fourth Test in Delhi and finished with nine wickets for the match. \nSTEVE O’KEEFE \nCareer: 4 Tests, 14 wickets at 32.78 In India: N/A \nO’Keefe may not have played a Test there to date, but he has nonetheless enjoyed his time in India. He claimed 14 wickets at 20.07 in a two-match Australia A tour in 2015, including figures of 6-82 in the first innings in Chennai. And he took six wickets at 16.66 for NSW in the now-defunct T20 Champions League six years ago. He has also played a handful of limited overs matches for the Australia U19s in India. \nO’Keefe has taken half his Test wickets in Asia — namely in Dubai against Pakistan and in Pallekelle against Sri Lanka. \nMITCHELL SWEPSON \nCareer : N/A \nIn India : N/A \nThe bolter of the touring party. With only 14 first class matches to his name, Swepson has held out the challenge of Travis Head for the final spin-bowling/all-rounder position. Save for high school trips, Swepson has had precious little experience outside Australia - he has played all his first class, List A and Twenty20 cricket on these shores. \nThe 23-year-old is the equal fifth leading wicket-taker in the Big Bash League this season with nine at 20.11. Trevor Hohns has described him as a “wicket-taking leg spinner” and Shane Warne has sung his praises during the summer. THE QUICKS \nMITCHELL STARC \nCareer: 34 Tests, 143 wickets at 24.33 In India: 2 Tests, 2 wickets at 36.25 \nStarc’s major Test contribution in India to date was with the bat when he clubbed a career-best 99 from 144 balls at No. 9 in the first innings in Mohali. He also claimed the wickets of Murali Vijay and MS Dhoni during the match. \nStarc went wicketless in his only ODI in India, but has fared better in the Indian Premier League. He has taken 34 wickets at 20.38 for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. media_camera Matt Renshaw and Mitchell Starc. \nJOSH HAZLEWOOD \nCareer: 26 Tests, 109 wickets at 24.78 In India: N/A \nHazlewood will enter the Border-Gavaskar series as the world’s No. 1 ranked Test fast bowler. Whether he will still be holding that mantle afterwards is anyone’s guess given how little elite cricket he has played in India. \nHazlewood has played two Twenty20 internationals, claiming one wicket, and been contracted by the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, albeit without playing a game for them. He perform solidly on Australia’s Test tour of Sri Lanka with seven wickets at 32.71. \nJACKSON BIRD \nCareer: 8 Tests, 34 wickets at 27.47 In India: N/A \nBird has never played a Test, ODI or T20I in Asia. He took 0-10 for Australia against an Indian Board President’s XI in Chennai four years ago. And he took six wickets at 25.00 in seven U19 ODIs way back in 2005 and 2006.
