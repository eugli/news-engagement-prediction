The ladies, sit down,” Winston said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “But all my boys, stand up. We strong, right? We strong! We strong, right? All my boys, tell me one time: I can do anything I put my mind to. Now, a lot of boys aren’t supposed to be soft-spoken. You know what I’m saying? One day y’all are going to have a very deep voice like this [in deep voice]. One day, you’ll have a very, very deep voice. \n“But the ladies, they’re supposed to be silent, polite, gentle. My men, my men [are] supposed to be strong. I want y’all to tell me what the third rule of life is: I can do anything I put my mind to.” \n… \n\nGotta be THE MOST Jameis Winston thing ever to cause a controversy during a speech at a fucking elementary school. Seriously you can count the number of people who could manage to fuck this up on one hand and Jameis is right there as the pointer finger. Talking to 3rd graders. Being a professional athlete and having to give a quick speech to 9 year olds. Almost impossible to come out of that making news headlines for being offensive but somehow Jameis managed to do it. \n\nWinston later tried to clarify that he was trying to motivate a particular student without singling him out. \n“I was making an effort to interact with a young male in the audience who didn’t seem to be paying attention, and I didn’t want to single him out, so I asked all the boys to stand up,” Winston said, according to the newspaper. “During my talk, I used a poor word choice that may have overshadowed that positive message for some.” \n\nDoes anybody love talking about being strong more than Jameis? Guy is just obsessed with strength.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:41:35.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
