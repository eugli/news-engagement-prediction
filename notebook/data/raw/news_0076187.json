Over the summer, Streep mocked then-candidate Trump by debuting an outrageous caricature of him. And at last month’s Golden Globes, she publicly condemned his behavior and policies, saying, “When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” Trump subsequently responded to Streep’s comments by calling her “one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.” \nOn the heels of this weekend’s Academy Awards, it’s unclear whether Streep will be able to make it to Washington, DC by tomorrow.
