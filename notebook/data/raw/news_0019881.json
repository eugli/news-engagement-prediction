Together my family and the company celebrate the tremendous man he was, and we will continue to work hard to uphold his remarkable legacy. I'm honored to have had the opportunity to work with him to nurture and grow our businesses, but mostly, I'm grateful to have called him my Dad, and I know my siblings feel the same.\" \nIlitch lived a pretty full life. Out of high school, he was in the Marine Corps for four years. He was then a minor-league baseball player for another four ( check out his baseball-reference.com page here ). When that didn't work out, he started a small pizza business with his wife in 1959, called Little Caesars Pizza Treat. They grew it into a monster. \nBy 1982, he was able to purchase the Red Wings in the NHL . At the time, they had missed the playoffs five straight years and in 10 of the previous 12 years. Since, they have only missed the playoffs twice and have made it every single time since 1990, winning four Stanley Cups. He is in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Ilitch holds the 2008 Stanley Cup.

It took a while for success to set in, but the Tigers won the American League pennant in 2006 and then won four straight AL Central titles from 2011-14, winning another pennant in 2012.

Getty Images \nIn recent years, the Tigers have repeatedly carried robust payrolls compared to their market size, thanks to Ilitch's desire to put the emphasis more on the on-field product than the business bottom line. \nExpect the ownership of both the Red Wings and Tigers to remain in the Ilitch family for the foreseeable future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:51:07.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
