There are no photos of Obama drinking anything but water at the restaurant. \nA group of guests sprayed more than 200 bottles of $125 Veuve Clicquot champagne on the holiday weekend, racking them up an estimated $25,000 bill. \nLater that day, Obama and friends reportedly stopped by famous nightclub Bootsy Bellows. \nObama has been keeping busy in her post-White House life and has not shied away from making political statements, despite her father stating that she has no interest in going into politics.
