The senator, who first accused the Dutertes of having some P2.4 billion in bank during the campaign period in 2016, said he had written to the AMLC on Tuesday to \" request for a list of all flagged/reported bank transactions of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte from 2006 onwards, after the latter said in a speech that he has directed the AMLC to release his bank transaction.\" “I believe that President Duterte’s public announcement to release his bank transactions is just a political bluff because simply writing a waiver addressed to the bank would have been much simpler. Nonetheless, I am calling his bluff and I have written to AMLC to publicly release said information,” the opposition senator said. AMLC LETTER.
