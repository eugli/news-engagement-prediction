But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... When rheumatoid arthritis flares up, it’s hard to keep up your healthy routine, such as sleeping enough, eating healthful meals and keeping up with daily exercise. But that’s exactly what’ll get you feeling better, says Pamela Peeke, MD , a nationally renowned fitness and rheumatoid arthritis expert, chief medical correspondent for Discovery Health TV and author of bestselling books, including Body-for-LIFE for Women: A Woman's Plan for Physical and Mental Transformation (Rodale). Her advice to rheumatoid arthritis patients is simple: “Get up and move! It can be done safely.” In this Lifescript interview, Dr. Peeke explains how exercise for rheumatoid arthritis can ease pain and how to go about it. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... How does exercise help women with rheumatoid arthritis maintain good health? Exercise plays a huge role in helping women with RA maintain daily functions. They enjoy an increased range of motion, which increases the level of activity they can engage in. Many women with rheumatoid arthritis come to me and say they’re at the end of their running and hiking days. My patients and I customize a program, a blueprint they can follow. We navigate around acute inflammation. Physical activity decreases the rapidity with which RA evolves. The more physical activity you engage in, the more you can live a full, wonderful life. How often should women with rheumatoid arthritis exercise? Every day of their lives. You don’t have to run an Olympics marathon – [just] stay up and active. The U.S. physical guidelines for Americans call for 150 minutes a week (2 hours, 30 minutes), or about 30 minutes per day. You can exercise 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. That includes physical activities you go out of your way to do, plus daily activities, like going up and down stairs and walking to buses. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... What if a woman with rheumatoid arthritis has a flare-up? Just because a certain joint isn’t functioning well doesn’t mean that other parts of your body are affected. There are creative ways to stay physically active when you have a chronic condition like RA. Some days require much wider leeway than others. You don’t have to exercise with the same intensity level every day. Just make sure you stand up! How can a woman with RA tailor exercise for rheumatoid arthritis to her mobility? She needs to have an excellent support team. After you’re diagnosed with RA, find a rheumatoid arthritis specialist. I sit down with patients and do an inventory of which joints are involved: ankle, finger, wrist or toes. Then we categorize where flares happen most. You get to know your condition by understanding how it manifests in your body, not another woman’s. From there, we customize your activity. If your weight-bearing joints are fine, you can walk. It’s good to lift weights, but if your hands aren’t strong, we devise other [easier] ways to get resistance training. You don’t have to use huge steel weights. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... What are some of those alternatives? Pushing your own weight is easier and cheaper than weight-bearing work in a gym. If you can, do bent-knee push-ups on the floor. It hits six muscles at the same time, including your glutes, arms and shoulders. Can a woman with rheumatoid arthritis do that if she’s having issues with her wrists or elbows? In that case, stand next to a wall and do “push-off-the-wall” push-ups. Just step back one foot from the wall and lean gently into it. Don’t lean too far – you’re supporting your entire body weight in various levels, depending how far you stand back. If you want to lift weights but your fingers hurt, try weights that wrap around your palms. They’re available in 1, 3 and 5 pounds. You don’t have to wrap them tightly around your fingers – just anchor them to your palms. There are many simple ways to bear weight. As women age – that’s after 40 – it’s important to stay flexible and strong [and] maintain your core and balance. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... Is there a minimum amount of exercise a woman with rheumatoid arthritis should do, even when she’s in pain? Use common sense. If you have horrible pain, take a day off [from exercise]. I tell women with flare-ups to make sure they’re on appropriate [treatments]. And take a holistic approach to your condition. Make a connection between the flare-up and something you might have done. Is it stress at work, deadlines or not enough sleep? That’s a red alert, [so] back off exercise that day, deal with the pain and consult your RA specialist. What are the best exercises for rheumatoid arthritis? The top three types of exercise involve flexibility, strength and aerobics . You want to balance and torque your joints and muscles. Flexibility: Stretching exercises keep joints and muscles limber. Ball stretches are fantastic. In fact, throw away your ergonomic chair! Sit on a ball instead. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... Aerobics: These exercises improve heart health and help build endurance for other exercises. They include walking, swimming, bicycling and aerobic classes. Strength: Resistance exercise builds muscle strength. You can use weight-lifting machines or free weights. These are recommended only 2-3 days per week. Is aqua therapy a good exercise for rheumatoid arthritis? It’s wonderful! I’m a big fan of swimming. You’re not bearing your own weight, which is important if those joints have pain. How should a woman with rheumatoid arthritis get started on a water exercise program? Vary your swimming stroke. If you have shoulder pain, do simple stretches and aerobics in the pool. It’s important to be comfortable and familiar with which body parts are more vulnerable to flare-ups, then work around them. Don’t look at what’s wrong with you. Rather, look at what’s right. Feel empowered. [Think:] My fingers may be out of commission, but the rest of me is OK. I can navigate around those fingers. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... What exercises can women do at work to ease rheumatoid arthritis pain? There are a lot of neat things you can do in a chair. Simple stretches, for example. Also, get out of the chair. If you’re having a painful day, make an excuse to [stand] for 5 minutes every hour. Lie – if you have to – [so you can] get out of your seat. [For example], say, “I have to walk over and see so-and-so.”It’s very important to move around. Make it fun. Bring elastic tubing with handles with you and pull it the best you can. Do stretches while standing. Touch your toes, reach for the ceiling, do yoga stretches. If your hands hurt, [move your legs and] take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk a bit. How do you motivate women with rheumatoid arthritis to exercise when they’re in too much pain to move? On days like that, you can really cause pain [so] you need a day off. It’s appropriate to stop. E xercising can be tough when moving is painful because of rheumatoid arthritis. But working can help ease symptoms, says Pamela Peeke, MD, one of the nation’s top fitness physicians. In this Lifescript interview, she explains which workouts to start with and how often to do them... Women who want to relieve stress, however, should try a short walk. Take it very slowly and make it as pleasant as possible, to detract from the pain. [For example,] put mellow music on your iPod. Do it on a much calmer scale than usual. Be compassionate with yourself. Women tell me, “I’ll gain 900 pounds if I don’t walk every single day.” Nonsense. Listen to your body. If you’re in pain, get vertical in a simpler fashion. Are there certain times of the month when exercise for rheumatoid arthritis is more difficult? We’ve found that women experiencing PMS or who are perimenopausal can have an accompanying RA flare, making exercise more difficult. Stress hormones – called cortisol – course along with a woman’s sex hormones when she enters her menstrual cycle. The cortisol rises and causes them to feel more agitated and irritable. Compound that with typical life stresses and you’re suddenly vulnerable to an RA flare-up. Then exercise takes a beating. Remember to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.
