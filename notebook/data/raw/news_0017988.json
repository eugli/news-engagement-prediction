Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nJamie O'Hara has met up with his children for what appears to be the first time since being evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house last month. \nThe 30-year-old footballer documented his reunion with his three boys on social media, after talking candidly about how much he pays his ex-wife Danielle Lloyd for their maintenance during his time in the house. \nPosting a snap of himself with Archie, Harry and George on Instagram, Jamie captioned it: \"Family weekend nothing better than having my boys in my arms, now gonna jump around the place and prob break my ankle #boys #family #jumpgiants .\" Jamie shared this snap of himself and a friend with their kids (Photo: jamie.ohara/Instagram) \nHe also tweeted a selfie of the four of them enjoying breakfast with the caption: \"Service station stop with my little hero's.\" \nJamie then took to Snapchat to show his followers what he was getting up to with his sons - which included a full run-down of what they'd all eaten for breakfast followed by a playing session at an indoor gymnastics hall. He and his three boys have been reunited following his CBB stint (Photo: @Mrjamieohara1 /Twitter) \nIt comes after Danielle's fans trolled Jamie after she revealed her fiancé Michael had taught youngest son George to ride a bike. \nThe star split from Jamie in 2014 after two years of marriage, following allegations he cheated on her. \nProud mum Danielle shared a video with her Instagram followers showing her boy cycling through the house, and revealed it was Michael who taught him. Danielle is so proud of Michael (Photo: missdlloyd/Instagram) \n\"In shock this morning didn't even know Michael had taught George to ride his bike,\" she wrote. \"Proud mummy.\" \nMany fans were quick to praise her son on the achievement, and applaud the sweet boy for how well he's doing. \n\"How lovely, no stopping him now, move everything in sight,\" joked one commenter, while another appeared to hint that Michael was stepping on toes by teaching his stepson the skill with Jamie missing out.
