Johnathan Cromwell Chesapeake Sheriff's Office \nRudolph said the contract was initially suspended while authorities investigated. \"Shortly after the arrest was made, the [homeowners' association] was able to get together and formally cancel it,\" he said. \nAndrew Sacks, an attorney for the security company, did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday. \nChen, a grandfather and an immigrant from China, was fatally shot five times on Jan. 26 while in his minivan outside the River Walk clubhouse. A family attorney has said Chen went to the clubhouse parking lot that night to play Pokemon Go, a GPS-based virtual reality game. \nSacks has said Cromwell opened fire in self-defense after Chen drove his van toward the security guard. He has also said Chen had previously been served a notice barring him from a community area he had visited after hours. \nCromwell was charged last Thursday with second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. He was arraigned last week and has been in custody since. \nCromwell's defense attorney did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday morning.

Courtesy of the Chen Family \nHarry Zhang, president of the Eastern Virginia chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, a group helping the Chen family, told NBC News a bond hearing originally scheduled for Thursday was postponed until Monday. \nZhang said the date change was to allow a Chinese-language interpreter to be present for the court hearing. \nA number of questions remain about the shooting, which prompted U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) and two Virginia congressmen to issue a joint statement last week calling for answers. \nRELATED: Politicians, Advocates Call for Answers in Fatal Shooting of Grandfather \nAmong them is whether Cromwell should have been carrying a gun while on patrol. \nThe association maintains that its contract with Citywide Protection Services was for unarmed services. But Sacks, the company's attorney, has said it was for both armed and unarmed services, and said it was up to the company to decide which to provide.
