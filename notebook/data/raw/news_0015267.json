He is said to be on a break in Switzerland as he finishes it and is looking for a British publisher. A friend of the author said: 'Goncalo took no great pleasure from the court case because he fully expected to win. For him these battles in the courts are important because they protect freedom of expression. Mr Amaral is said to be putting the finishing touches to his second book and wants it to be published in English 'He could only afford to pay the legal bills thanks to donations, mainly from people in Britain, who have given more than Â£50,000. With the support in Britain he obviously thinks his second book on the case would sell well if translated into English and he is actively looking for a publisher. 'He would also ask any publisher if they would be interested in publishing his first book in English.' The McCanns are said to be prepared to sue if the book is sold in the UK. Mr Amaral worked on the case when Madeleine, then three, went missing from the apartment the McCanns were staying in in Praia da Luz as Kate and Gerry ate dinner with friends. He was moved off the case and resigned six months later but wrote his book using police files as he put forward a theory she had died in the apartment. The McCanns took legal action, saying there was no evidence and his work was defamatory. The appeal hearing in Lisbon which ruled against the McCanns was held in private. A spokesperson from their lawyer's office said: 'This is a big disappointment and very bitter for us and for Mr and Mrs McCann. The McCanns believe their daughter is alive and are continuing the search for her. Scotland Yard are investigating one last throw of the dice 'We know the libel decision has gone against us but we do not know the basis of the ruling and will not find out until Thursday.' Mr Amaral, 56, who the McCanns first sued for libel in June 2009, won the lengthy legal fight after judges decided he had the 'right to freedom of expression.' Madeleine's parents could now lodge an appeal to the highest court in Europe, the European Court of Human Rights. But a source close to the exasperated couple said: 'I think the fight is finally over. They want to concentrate on finding Madeleine and don't think they have the time or energy to lodge yet another appeal.' Scotland Yard are busy investigating one 'last throw of the dice' lead in a bid to end the family's torment but time could be running out as police now have just two months left of guaranteed Government funding to continue to unravel an 'important' new tip. Detectives on the Madeleine inquiry recently revealed they are working on a final theory that the youngster was kidnapped by a European trafficking gang. The 'spotters' are believed to have targeted the blonde toddler taking photographs of her while she was playing on the beach and beside the pool at her holiday apartment.
