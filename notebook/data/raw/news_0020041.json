Amaral claimed his work was based on publicly available police and court files on the case. Kate described the book as “devastating and distressing”.\nAmaral successfully overturned the ruling against him last April and the McCanns lodged a Supreme Court appeal.\nBut judges decided Amaral’s claims were “within admissible limits in a democratic and open society”. It means Kate and Gerry, both 48, face having to pay Amaral’s legal bills and could even be sued by him.\nKate and Gerry McCann outside court (Photo: Daily Mirror) The McCanns may take the case to the European courts, but legal experts say they must prove they have a valid reason of appeal before any hearing would be even considered.\nMadeline vanished from an apartment in Praia da Luz as her parents ate at a nearby restaurant. Detectives are said to be working on a theory that she was kidnapped by a European trafficking gang.\n  Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily   More On Gerry McCann Madeleine Mccann Court case", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:49:30.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
