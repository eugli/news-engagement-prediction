It happened again this week when the main event of SmackDown Live saw a battle royal for the number one contender position end up with both AJ Styles and Luke Harper hitting the floor at the same time. \nMick Foley, the general manager of Monday Night Raw , was critical of the ending and went to Twitter to say that he or Stephanie McMahon would have done things differently than they did on SmackDown Live . He mentioned instant replay. Isn't that what instant replay is for? @StephMcMahon or I would have come to a different conclusion. #SDLive \n— Mick Foley (@RealMickFoley) February 22, 2017 \nIt is an interesting statement from Mick Foley because the night before on Monday Night Raw , Bayley was asked to give up her women’s title for winning it through outside interference but nothing could be done – despite the fact that there was instant replay into the situation. [Image by WWE] \nOf course, it was two different situations where the management would not overturn a referee’s final decision on Monday Night Raw while SmackDown Live saw two referees confused at the outcome. Despite the criticism, it isn’t the first time that the WWE has used a tie in a battle royal to further the storyline. \nIn the case of SmackDown Live , Daniel Bryan went on Talking Smack after the show ended and announced that AJ Styles and Luke Harper would wrestle next week to determine the new number one contender to Bray Wyatt and the WWE world title. That should be an amazing main event for SmackDown Live since Luke Harper is finally showing what he can do. [Image by WWE] \nBefore SmackDown Live and it’s ending this week, the most famous instance of a battle royal ending in a tie came at the Royal Rumble in 1994. Lex Luger had come over from WCW, and Vince McMahon was pushing him to the top. The end came when Luger and Bret “The Hitman” Hart went over the top and to the floor at the same time. \nThe WWE chose to allow both Lex Luger and Bret Hart to get title matches at WrestleMania X against Yokozuna as long as both men also wrestled a second match on the show as well. That was the show where Owen Hart beat Bret Hart and then Bret won the world title from Yokozuna, who had already beaten Lex Luger on the show. \nIt looks like this SmackDown Live controversy will also lead to an interesting WrestleMania event. Randy Orton won the Royal Rumble this year but then came out on SmackDown Live last week and said he refused to fight Bray Wyatt for the title. That resulted in the battle royal that aired on SmackDown Live . \nRELATED WWE REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:05:56.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
