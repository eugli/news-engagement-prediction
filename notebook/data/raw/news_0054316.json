The duo have written and produced number one singles for Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey and Usher, among many others. 'Changed the way we listen' \nSongwriters are eligible for induction after writing hit tracks for at least 20 years. \nThis explains why Jay-Z is being inducted now - as he recently passed the 20th anniversary of his debut album Reasonable Doubt, released in 1996. \nChic guitarist Nile Rodgers, who was one of last year's inductees, said Jay-Z had \"changed the way we listen to music\". \nMadonna and George Michael were both nominated this year as well but weren't chosen this time. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
