The device comes with an FCC ID of PY7-84773W, and although there’s no official info on what its commercial name might be, the assumption is that it could be the rumored Xperia XA2 – which is expected to be unveiled at the upcoming MWC trade show in Barcelona later this month. While the Japanese consumer electronics giant is yet to say anything officially about the Xperia XA2, recent rumors have claimed that it will be a mid-range smartphone, powered by a MediaTek chip, and will sit a notch below the company’s high-end Xperia X-series devices. \nWhile the Xperia XA2 is expected to replace the first-generation Xperia XA that was launched last year, it is important to remember that there’s no official confirmation from Sony on whether the device cleared by the FCC is indeed the upcoming Xperia XA2. According to the rumors though, the device will come with a MediaTek Helio X20 SoC under the hood. It will also reportedly have 4GB of RAM, which is expected to become more common among mid-range devices this year – what with premium handsets such as the Asus ZenFone AR already starting to offer as much as 8GB of RAM. Even Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 has been rumored to ship with 8GB of RAM, although the company itself is yet to say anything about that officially. \nMeanwhile, some of the other key tech specs of the upcoming Sony Xperia XA2 include a 23-megapixel primary camera with an f/2.0 aperture and a 16-megapixel secondary camera with an f/2.2 aperture. The device is also expected to come with a USB Type-C port and a 3.5 mm audio port, although the latter is slowly losing favor among many major smartphone manufacturers over the past year or so. On the software side of things, the upcoming handset is expected to run on Android 7.0 (Nougat), which is certainly good news for potential buyers. Rumors also seem to suggest that in China, the Xperia XA2 will be priced at 2,200 Yuan, which is around $320 (€300). A detail which if correct does go some way to confirming the mid-level positioning of this smartphone.
