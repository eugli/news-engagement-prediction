He’s going to be around a while. (AP) More Every few years a prospect will come along that makes scouts jump out of their seats.\nIn 2017, that prospect’s name is Hunter Greene.\n[ Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Baseball | 2017 Player Rankings ]\nGreene is entering his senior season at Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Once that wraps up, he’s expected to be a high pick in the 2017 MLB amateur draft, perhaps going No. 1 overall to the Minnesota Twins .\nYes, the hype is strong with Greene, and so far he’s backed it up with ridiculous numbers. During his junior season, he batted .419 with five homers and 18 extra base hits overall. After the season, he cemented his power by winning the home run derby at the Perfect Game All-American Classic.\nOh, and we should probably mention he’s actually a better pitcher than he is a hitter. His fastball usually sits in the high 90s, but he’s already hit 100 mph during an outing this season.\nHeard RHP/SS Hunter Greene of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame hit 100 mph tonight #MLBDraft\n— keithlaw (@keithlaw) February 4, 2017\nPretty amazing for a 17-year-old.\nThat powerful arm helped him post a 1.63 ERA to go along with 68 strikeouts over 55.2 innings last year, and will no doubt boost his prospects whether he elects pitching or playing shortstop at the next level.\nBeyond his undeniable baseball talent though, Greene is simply a ridiculous athlete.

This drill helps with my velocity. Explosion! pic.twitter.com/7YEpPlrJYj\n— Hunter Greene (@HunterGreene17) February 1, 2017\nBeat that, Bryce Harper .\nOf course, such feats of machine-like explosiveness do not always translate to baseball success. We’re guessing it won’t hurt Greene though. In fact, being able to combine this level of athleticism with his baseball skills should only help his already sky-high stock.\nHere’s a look at him in action last season:\nWhew.\nIt’s one thing to hear and read about it, it’s another to see it.\nThough Greene is committed to UCLA, it’s difficult to imagine him making a stop in college. Not only is he a top prospect, but he appears to be on the fast track to stardom.\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n– – – – – – –\nMark Townsend is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.
