'We were supposed to land in Dublin at 12.20pm. The pilot tried to land but took off again. We were told we were diverting to Shannon and we arrived there at 1.15pm.' Up to 25 passengers were so scared by their ordeal that they refused to continue on the flight back to Dublin, according to the witness. Flight FR-7257: Families on board the Boeing 737 travelling from Madrid were left shaken when the plane had to abort its landing at Dublin Airport during high winds and divert to Shannon But they were told at 3.30pm that it could take until 7pm to allow them to leave Shannon Airport if they decided not to board. The Ryanair flight from Madrid was diverted to Shannon and eventually landed at Dublin A Ryanair spokesman said: 'This flight from Madrid to Dublin diverted to Shannon due to high winds at Dublin Airport. 'The aircraft landed normally and a number of customers requested to disembark and did so, before the aircraft was cleared to depart to Dublin. 'Ryanair apologised to all customers affected by this weather diversion, which was entirely beyond our control.' A source at the airline added that the plane left for Dublin at 4.45pm and denied there was a six-hour wait.
