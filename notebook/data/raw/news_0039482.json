LOUIS • A 16-year-old boy is in custody in the fatal shooting of a 72-year-old visitor to St. Louis during a carjacking attempt last week, police said Wednesday. \nThe shooting happened Friday in the 3800 block of Juniata Street. \nThe teen is being held as a juvenile on charges of second-degree murder, robbery and armed criminal action, police said. He was arrested on Sunday in connection to an armed robbery that occurred in the 3200 block of Samuel Shepard Drive earlier on the same night as the fatal shooting on Juniata. \nDuring that robbery, a 2009 Hyundai Sonata was taken. Further investigation revealed the stolen vehicle was connected to the homicide on Juniata, police said. \nInvestigators are still searching for a second suspect. \nPolice on Monday identified the victim in the shooting on Juniata as Kenneth Spalter, 72, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., a small town in Westchester County near New York City. \nPolice said two men approached Spalter and a woman, 71, as they were getting out of a car and demanded their keys and car. Spalter struggled with the suspects, and one of robbers shot Spalter once, killing him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:15:10.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
