Go back home!'\nEventually, after trudging through swamps and sitting on a small boat among a huddled mass of travelers, Busch arrives in Missouri.\nA man, who conveniently happens to stroll past the signature Budweiser Clydesdale horses, approaches and says: 'Welcome to St Louis, son.'\nHe then heads inside a pub, where a man - who is revealed to be Eberhard Anheuser, with whom Busch would form Budweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch - offers him a beer.\nBusch (left) is seen in the ad receiving a hostile welcome, with locals shouting at him to leave the country and go home\nBusch then shows Anheuser a sketching of a bottle adorned with the Budweiser logo, and the pair shake hands.\nThe commercial is sure to be seen by many as political, given the current climate created by Donald Trump surrounding immigration, however the alcohol behemoth said it was not made with that in mind.\n'This story celebrates Adolphus Busch's American dream and the bold vision to brew the best beer in the world,' Budweiser 'master brewer' Peter Kraemer said.\nBut the ad then continues to show Busch (right) unveiling his dream beer to a man in a bar - who turns out to be Eberhard Anheuser, with whom Busch would form Budweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch\nBudweiser Vice President Ricardo Marques (pictured) said: 'This commercial shows the start of Budweiser’s journey, and while it is set in the 1800s, it's a story we believe will resonate with today's entrepreneurial generation'\n'While everyone knows Budweiser, they don't necessarily know our story and how we came to be brewed the hard way.'\nBudweiser Vice President Ricardo Marques added: 'This commercial shows the start of Budweiser’s journey, and while it is set in the 1800s, it's a story we believe will resonate with today's entrepreneurial generation - those who continue strive for their dreams.'\nThe company added the ad had been in the works before Trump signed his travel ban last week.\nThe beer giant however said it is not in response to Donald Trump's travel ban, adding it had been in the works before that was announced last week\nPolitically-intended or not, the commercial is certainly pricey for Budweiser.\nA 30-second spot came with a $5million price-tag for Sunday's Super Bowl, according to the New York Times, meaning Anheuser-Busch would have shelled out $10million.\nThis year is the 28th in which Budweiser was the exclusive beer advertiser during the Super Bowl, and the 42nd Anheuser Busch has been part of.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/business/5-million-for-a-super-bowl-ad-another-million-or-more-to-market-the-ad.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T19:20:24.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
