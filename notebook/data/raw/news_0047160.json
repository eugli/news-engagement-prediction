He wasn't wearing his glasses, but he noticed as they approached that they had their guns drawn.\n\"I was shocked,\" he said.\n\"Your body is just screaming, 'Something bad is going to happen to you. You are going to get hurt.'\"\nHe didn't know it, but a stabbing that had taken place not far from where he was would lead to an incident that left him angry and in shock.\nMontreal police, officer ordered to pay $17K for racial discrimination 'Very hard' takedown, witness says Burke, an illustrator, said police pinned him to the wall, handcuffed him, slammed him to the ground, dragged him onto the street and starting searching his pockets.\nHe said he asked the officers why he was being apprehended, and police told him to shut up and stop resisting.\n\"I said, 'I'm not resisting you, I'm just asking why this is happening,'\" he said.\nRichard Zilberg was inside the dépanneur and saw the altercation take place.\nHe said he saw police officers draw guns, pin Burke against the window, and he watched as one officer took him down \"very hard.\"\n\"What I felt was that there was a very serious crime, because why would they be very aggressive?
