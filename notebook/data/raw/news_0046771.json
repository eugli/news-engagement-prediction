It's in a newspaper, it's not something secretive and it's so sad that this is happening. \n\"It's frustrating, because it closes a person down, not being able to get information and knowing what's happening on the outside, it's like they're closed off. To me that's not healthy.\" \nMs Grieve also said that conditions for visitors and prisoners were better at the old prison in Berrimah, despite it once being described by the then Commissioner as only \"fit for a bulldozer\". \n\"At Berrimah they allowed inmates to purchase newspapers, have Walkmans, their own fans, their own TVs, shoes, there were vending machines in the visiting areas to buy snacks,\" Ms Grieve said. \n\"In the new prison newspapers are disallowed, musical instruments are a no-no, the Walkmans were no longer allowed, fans and TVs were sent home from Berrimah, they have vending machines in the visiting areas but they're empty. \n\"There's a lot of difference between the old and the new prison.\" \nThe Holtze prison opened in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:53:34.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
