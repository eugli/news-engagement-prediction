Metal is normally used as a joke and punchline on these programs so it's incredible to see it respected like in the video above from The Voice Québec . In the clip, Louis-Paul Gauvreau growls Necrophagist 's \"Stabwound\" and is actually picked by a judge on national television. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 30417, \"name\" : \"Necrophagist\" } } \nNot only is his performance great to the discerning metalhead, it's amazing to see the genre get the recognition it deserves. French Canadian pop/country/folk artist Isabelle Boulay chose to mentor Louis-Paul in the competition and we can't wait to see how far he goes. You can check out his band The Unconcious Mind here . {\"position1\":{\"name\":\"Necrophagist\",\"id\":30417,\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.iheart.com\\/artist\\/necrophagist-30417\",\"type\":\"artist\",\"errors\":null,\"tagged\":true}} ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:44:17.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
