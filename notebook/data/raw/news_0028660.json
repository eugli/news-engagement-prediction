In the past two recruiting classes, they’ve had plenty of success in Florida. Led by recently promoted offensive coordinator Larry Scott , running backs coach Robert Gillespie and wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni , Tennessee signed seven players from the Sunshine State in the 2017 class — more than the Vols landed in any state other than Tennessee. Tennessee finished with eight in-state prospects in its 2017 recruiting class, which consists of 28 players. But the Vols leaned almost as heavily on Florida, where they also signed five players in the 2016 class. “The last couple of years, Florida has been extremely productive for us, and we’re excited to sign seven individuals from the Sunshine State,” Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. “There’s a lot that goes into it. Obviously, Larry Scott does a great job. Robert Gillespie does a great job, and Zach Azzanni .” Jones pointed out that Azzanni recruits a large portion of South Florida for the Vols, including talent-filled Broward County — the home of powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas High School, where Tennessee signed three-star wide receiver Josh Palmer and three-star defensive tackle Kivon Bennett . Scott said Tennessee didn’t necessarily plan to find so many of its 2017 signees in the state of Florida. He said it simply was a result of the “sheer volume of the players that are there.” (What's next for the Vols?

I think you have to have some established relationships and some things in those areas that people know you, know what you’re all about. “And then you also have to have a great brand that you can sell to people. And when you walk in there and you carry the ’T’ with you, it’s pretty strong.” Tennessee often has leaned heavily on the state of Georgia in recruiting, and Jones’ staff has ventured more frequently into other surrounding states, including North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama. But the Vols signed just three players from Georgia in the 2017 class, with home-state school Georgia finding early in-state success under coach Kirby Smart’s staff. It’s the fewest players Tennessee has landed from the Peach State since 2008. That contributed to the Vols’ decision to turn to other states, including Louisiana, where they signed three players in the 2017 class. But they were more successful in Florida than anywhere else. Vols freshman linebacker Shanon Reid (Photo: Tennessee athletics, UTSports.com) Jones said Tennessee has “great inroads” in the Sunshine State. But he said it was a “group effort” that led to the Vols signing a quarter of its class in Florida, including Top247 linebacker Shanon Reid , three-star defensive end Deandre Johnson , three-star wide receiver Jacquez Jones , three-star running back Timothy Jordan and three-star tight end James Brown . “You have a lead recruiter, and you have areas in which you recruit,” Jones said. “But, also, you have your position coach that’s involved, and then obviously your coordinators are involved. But, really, it’s a group effort, and I thought our coaching staff really worked well together. “Everything is, again, about relationships. We have great inroads in the state of Florida, and we’re excited about those inroads.” Scott, a Florida native who spent a combined 10 years coaching at South Florida and Miami before joining Tennessee’s staff last year, said when it comes to evaluating prospects, it doesn’t hurt that Florida is “a unique place where they’re playing football year-round.” “They’re all in these competitive 7-on-7s right now, and it goes all the way through the summertime,” he said. “And they’ve got spring ball, where they get 15 practices to go out in full pads and play. These kids today are just outside all the time, and they’re playing football all the time. And it’s a lot of them. “So you just take your pick. You go in where you’ve got the connections and relationships with people, and hopefully you can move them out of there.” Get VIP access to GoVols247 with a FREE 7-DAY TRIAL Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:03:28.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
