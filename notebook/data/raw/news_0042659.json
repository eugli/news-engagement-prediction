In its September 2016 publication, worldatlas.com revealed that the top 10 rice producing countries in the world are India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Pakistan. The site adds that: \"These countries are also among the top rice consumers of the world, and combine to account for around 90% of the worldâ€™s rice consumption. \"Both figures have been on the rise in the last couple of decades, and experts believe that there will be little or no decline in these numbers in the coming years\". ALSO READ: 'Nigeria feeds West, North and Central Africa,' - Presidency Countries like Thailand, India, and Vietnam produce around 9.5, 9.5 and 7 million metric tons of rice annually, respectively. In contrast, Nigeria presently produces 3 million metric tons and consumes 6 million metric tons of rice annually. 2016 data showed that Nigeria still ranks among the biggest importers of rice globally. That hasn't changed significantly in the first few months of 2017. Nigeria still doesn't produce enough rice to feed itself. Not yet. play Garba Shehu (Punch) So, where did Shehu get his data from? On Monday, February 20, 2017, instead of apologising for his apparent false claim, the presidential spokesperson chose to double down instead. Shehu told the world that CNN provided the data for his wild claims. \"We are not the first to say that Nigeria has grown to the second position in rice production worldwide. The CNN which is not a frivolous news source said this. We have reason to believe them because of their global reach\". And then, Shehu made a futile attempt to tone down an apparent mendacity. \"While we wait the numbers from the Food and Agricultural Organisation, FAO, we are collating our own figures and in the coming weeks, the officials in the Ministry of Agriculture will be coming up with our own position on rice production. \"Don't forget that since October last year, Nigeria has been feeding many parts of West Africa, North and Central Africa. \"Many of these countries have been shopping in Nigeria for rice, sorghum, sesame and millet. To support the growing rice industry, the Federal Government just acquired 110 rice milling machines which will be installed in different parts of the country between now and July. \"A lot is happening in Nigeria for which we should be proud.\" play Garba Shehu (Vanguard) President Buhari's spokesperson could easily have told the world what the federal government is doing to increase Nigeria's rice production levels without throwing bags of rice lies into the mix. What should have been a mea culpa from Shehu for a bare-faced lie became a defense tactic. It was appalling to read and watch. Yes, the federal government is doing a lot to reflate the economy and ramp up local food production levels, but to say Nigeria has overnight become the second largest producer of rice globally is the stuff that \"liar, liar, pants on fire\" is made of. Spokespersons should make an effort to go easy on the lies sometimes. It does them or their principals no good.
