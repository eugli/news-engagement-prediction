Just ask farming beauty Marcella Bakker. \nThe 24-year-old attracted plenty of offers when she posted on NZ Farming's Facebook page that she was looking for a man, but most were \"oldies with baggage.\" \nMost were in their 40s, had children and were divorced, she said. TOM LEE/FAIRFAX NZ \nMarcella Bakker hopes to move to Perth this year and also change from dairy farming to real estate. \n\"It was not really what I was looking for, because I don't have that sort of baggage I didn't feel I had to take that on.\" \nREAD MORE: Grand Designs NZ: Where are they now? \nSo she's heading to Oz. \nShe'll finish her Waikato dairy farm job in June and will head to Perth, where she wants to try out real estate. \nBut it's not like she hasn't given her search for love in New Zealand a solid go. \nHer Facebook post in September gained 631 reactions, it was shared 19 times and had over 700 comments. \nBakker is still single and thinks she took a wrong tack. Ad Feedback \n\"I regret it really bad. I didn't think it through and I'm quite impulsive sometimes. From that Facebook post stemmed all the wrong attention. \n\"I realised that perhaps I wasn't looking for a farmer at all. It's not actually a field I want to stay with myself, career-wise.\" \nAnd the Aussie male might just be a match for the spunky Kiwi chick. \n\"I've heard about them. They are apparently pretty egotistical, which is fun. I like breaking down the ego a little bit.\" \nBakker's dance card hasn't been entirely empty. She's dated a couple of guys since September who she met through working part time at Les Mills gym. \n\"I am pretty confident in myself to put myself out there. It's just a case of I know what I want and it's quite hard to find that in Hamilton.\" \nAnd she's not tempted by Tinder. \n\"I think, again, that is attracting that wrong field of people. It's probably my generation and younger - they're very immature and they want such different things in life. They don't want to aspire to marriage. For them it's cool to get with as many girls as they can and that's not okay with me. That is disrespectful and it's not what I am looking for. \n\"Honestly, it comes down to intelligence. I get quite frustrated with people who aren't on your level of thinking and a lot of guys are not emotionally smart. They don't understand where you are coming from. \n\"You have to explain to them all the time and that is kind of frustrating for me. I just need someone who's able to understand me and I guess it comes down to confidence as well, so that they aren't insecure. Because I am quite an outgoing person and that is an issue for people. \n\"Good looks is something as well, and that is really hard to find, too.\" \nAnd while she has done some modelling, she's not a girly girl. \n\"I love outdoors stuff. Recently I went down to Te Kaha and I went crayfish diving and fishing. I'm totally into that stuff - anything outdoors, like skiing. I'm not super into shopping - I'm not super girly like that \n\"I can dress to be, but on the inside, I'm kind of a tomboy.\" \nBakker realises that people may think she's being too fussy. \n\"I'm okay with that because I'm not looking for someone to just pass a bit of time.\" \n\"I'm not going to settle for any Joe Blogs because it has to work in the future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:18:02.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
