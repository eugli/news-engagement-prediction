We used that structure as a starting point to design the dress.\" JUST WATCHED Super substance may yield tech 'miracles'​ Replay More Videos ...

Read More The dress has graphene-enhanced sensors lined throughout the garment's top half that capture the wearer's breathing patterns. Read: Cool designs from bizarre materials A microprocessor that powers the dress analyzes this data, causing LED lights -- placed on transparent graphene elements -- on the dress to change color. MIT researchers make new graphene discovery Deep breaths turn the lights from purple to turquoise, while lighter ones make the LEDs switch from orange to green. Rosella, whose creations have been worn by the likes of Katy Perry and Nicole Scherzinger, called \"the world's first graphene dress\" a new step for the fashion industry. The futuristic LBD is on show at the intu Trafford Center, a shopping and leisure complex in Manchester, and is set to tour museums around the UK. Leveraging the 'wonder material's' properties Graphene was first discovered in 2002 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, physics professors at the University of Manchester. It won a Nobel Prize in 2010 and is known as a wonder material that's one atom thick. It's everything from lightweight and conductive to flexible and thermal. \"There's a lot of potential for graphene within the textile industry,\" Paul Wiper, a research associate at the National Graphene Institute who worked with Rosella, told CNN.

For instance, graphene can be made into a solution or powder that can be dispersed onto or combined with different materials to create a graphene composite that conducts electricity.

Wiper said that in the future, researchers could add a special graphene coating to clothes to improve their resistance to fire. Graphene-enhanced smog masks that shield the wearer from pollutants are another possibility. JUST WATCHED Discovering the world's strongest material Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nDiscovering the world's strongest material 02:25 In January, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology used computer modeling to design a new -- currently nameless -- material: a sponge-like configuration that is just 5% the density of steel and about 10 times as strong. Read: Clothes that change color with the climate This makes it both extraordinarily light but able to carry heavy loads -- properties that make graphene ideal for future use in design or architecture. For the moment, CuteCircuit's LBD has only made use of small amounts of graphene as the expensive material isn't yet mainstream. So while the dress provokes thought on the future uses of graphene, it'll still be some time before clothes combined with the material hit the mall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:15:18.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
