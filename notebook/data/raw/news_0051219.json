Queens cows are smartening up because this is the third cow in Queens to escape a slaughterhouse within the last 14 months, according to Gothamist . \n— Good Morning America (@GMA) February 21, 2017 \nPeople on social media and IRL were captivated by the intense chase while police were in hot pursuit. \nFor almost two hours, the cow evaded officers armed with tranquilizer equipment and generally caused a raucous as authorities repeatedly tried and failed to corral the animal. They tried cornering the cow again, and he escaped! https://t.co/tJElms6g1Q pic.twitter.com/Pq3cVNNgUv \n— Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 21, 2017 \nThe cow was apprehended in someone's backyard and half a dozen officers crowded it while its legs were immobilized.
