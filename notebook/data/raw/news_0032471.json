They look similar to runways but are not as wide, according to the FAA website. Planes landing on taxiways are in violation of FAA safety rules , the Orange County Register reports. \n“ Air traffic controllers cleared the pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L ” on Monday afternoon, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told the Los Angeles Times. “The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway.” \nAfter flying over the 737, the “Star Wars” actor reportedly asked air traffic controllers, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” according to NBC News.

The actor survived with lacerations to his scalp , according to CBS News. \nFord also crash-landed a helicopter during a lesson in Ventura, California , in 1999, NBC reported.
