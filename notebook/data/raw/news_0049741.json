Tiffany Trump shared what appears to be her latest project in an  Instagram story  on Monday night: DIY jewelry. She captioned her photo, “Work in progress…” Photo: @tiffanytrump/Instagram More Last that was reported on Tiffany’s career aspirations, she was aiming for less Etsy artist and more high-powered attorney, although nothing short of her father’s reduced funding for the arts could stop her from doing both. Tiffany recently  toured law schools the likes of Harvard, Columbia and New York University after reportedly taking the LSATs in December. But that’s not all she’s been up to: Trump also attended a slate of shows this New York Fashion Week, perhaps providing the inspiration for this seeming newfound desire to DIY.\nPhoto: @tiffanytrump/Instagram More She attended — and sat front row — at Taoray Wang, Philipp Plein, Dennis Basso, Vivienne Tam, in the company of more familiar celebs like Paris Hilton and Kylie Jenner. Conflicting reports emerged about her experience at Philipp Plein , with one Fashionista editor reporting that a “seating shitshow… because no editors want to sit near Tiffany Trump.” Trump’s friend and fellow rich kid of Instagram Andrew Warren tried to correct the story with a photo  of the two pals sitting front row. He captioned the photo, “Me and my best #lastnight at @philippplein78 @philipppleininternational (ps. That seat was never empty it was reserved for his family).”\nAlthough there’s been no official announcements or even hints aside from her own Instagram that Tiffany is starting her own brand, don’t forget that the middle Trump  does  have a creative side. I recommend you listen to her first and only single “Like a Bird”  to get a sense of what Tiffany’s jewelry might look like: “Diamonds are so shiny / Special things I got on me.”\nLet’s keep in touch!
