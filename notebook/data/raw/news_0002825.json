Trump's remark suggests he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used rally crowds on the campaign trail.\nA White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:33:23.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
