The work depicts Quinn as he appeared while coaching the 1994 Vancouver Canucks, and features the coach holding a roster card engraved with each player's name.\nKalli Quinn, the former coach's youngest daughter, said the statue captures his larger than life essence.\nShe also pointed to a bench located next to the statue as a small, but important detail.\n\"He was in Salt Lake during the Olympics,\" she said. \"The Olympics are special in their own right and he wanted to make sure he had all the experiences everybody else did.\"\n\"[There was a bench] outside of Canada House, he would sit out there every day either after practice or after the games, and the athletes of all sports would sit down and come talk to him.\n\"One day, he showed up to his bench and the athletes had put a sign on it saying 'Pat's Bench'. We still have that sign.\"\nQuinn said her father's legacy will also continue in a yet-to-be finalized Pat Quinn Scholarship fund. She said the fund would go specifically to hockey players or athletes who have finished their post-secondary education and want to pursue a professional designation â€” a nod to her father's law school degree.\nThe statue will be officially unveiled on Saturday, Feb. 18 at 6:15 p.m. PT before the Vancouver Canucks host the Calgary Flames later that night.\nWith files from The Early Edition", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:21:05.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
