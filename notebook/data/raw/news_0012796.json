Roger Goodell has been murdered by Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and David Portnoy. There is no other way to put it. He’s dead. Mark Brunell is dead. Troy Vincent is dead. Ted Wells is dead. Chris Mortensen is dead. Mike Kensil is dead. Mike Felger is dead. Everybody is fucking dead. The Patriots are the kings not only of football but the entire free world. It’s Brady’s 5th god damn Super Bowl. There are no asterisks, no question marks, no debate. The Pats are the greatest of all time. Teams like Atlanta start dabbing on the sidelines with a 3rd quarter lead. Teams like us come back and win Super Bowls. \nAnd once again I thank God for making me a Pats fan.
