The fringe impact \nWhere Luis Enrique is struggling, Zinedine Zidane is flying . Time and time again the French coach has been able to rotate and manoeuvre his starting XI to spread the load across several players, and with great success. As for the Blaugrana boss, he cannot buy a satisfactory line-up. Andre Gomes and Sergi Roberto are the chief suspects in terms of the side's lack of flair and yet neither are taken out the side by Luis Enrique. The coach's attitude \nLuis Enrique has never been chirpy with the media but recent weeks has seen his relationship with reporters fall off a cliff edge, stating how he never listens to them and working up a fuss on live television. Compare that to Zidane, where the ex-midfielder is bright and breezy with the press, making clear what he disagrees on but always in his natural, charismatic style. European fallout \nThere's no doubt that Real got the easier draw in the Champions League and that was despite coming second in their group, and the consequences have been huge. Sweeping past Napoli in their first leg, the 3-1 win gave Zidane the impetus to reintroduce Gareth Bale for the win over Espanyol on the weekend. In great contrast, Barcelona were hammered by Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital and responded with a dour scrape past Leganes. The contrasting fortunes of Messi and Ronaldo \nGreat rivals on and off the pitch, it seems that the respective clubs reliance on Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo is at opposite ends. The more the Azulgrana suffer, the more important their Argentine talisman is, leading the Pichichi race as he does. However, Madrid have managed to reduce Ronaldo's individual importance without dropping points. Strength across the midfield \nThe strength of Zidane's midfield is perhaps his biggest asset; Casemiro, Toni Kroos, and Luka Modric are backed up by Isco, Mateo Kovacic et al. This has provided balance, flair, and a seamless team ethic. While Luis Enrique can call upon the exquisite Andres Iniesta, providing he's fit, there has been a marked drop in form from Ivan Rakitic whilst Gomes, Denis Suarez, and Rafinha all lack the consistency or raw ability to fit the bill. The rise of ter Stegen \nOne are the Blaugrana can be happy with is the goalkeeper. Even in the defeat to PSG, Marc-Andre ter Stegen stood head and shoulders above the rest, making clear that he is the undisputed custodian at the Camp Nou. Meanwhile, Keylor Navas has been unable to do the same, sparking rumours that Real are in the market for a big name signing to replace him this summer. MSN vs. BBC \nFor all the talk of Madrid's BBC vs. Barcelona's MSN, Los Blancos haven't been able to field their preferred front-three in three months. This is typical of the more fluid approach to selection that Zidane has revelled in whereas Luis Enrique has persisted with his attack line and with imperfect results.
