My driving has always been good. I'm a professional driver for ten years. 'Due to the situation that this has put me in I've lost my job. I'm self-employed. 'My car broke down in October and I've been unable to get any financial backing to get my car back on the road. 'The doctors have put me on antidepressant medication because of this affecting my mental health.' He added that he felt it was strange that the new camera was fitted 'in April or May' but that he had received no tickets in April, May, June or July. When asked if he accepted he was exceeding the 30mph limit, he replied: 'Most of the time I drive with the flow of traffic. Holman shows his now revoked private hire driver's licence. He was caught exceeding the 30mph limit on each occasion over nine separate days 'I don't believe I was travelling at speeds in excess of the limit, but I have to accept that.' The court heard Holman had one previous matter against him - a fixed penalty notice for speeding in May 2015 for which he received three penalty points on his licence. After deliberation the chair of the magistrates said that would be handed three points for each incident, bringing it to a total of 42 points. He was also fined Â£355. Speaking outside court, Mr Holman said he was a taxi driver at the time of the offences, ferrying passengers to their destinations. He said: 'That camera was fitted in April and activated in May, but there's been nothing from anybody until August. 'It's disguised as a traffic light camera. It was all grey when it got me, but a few weeks later they painted it yellow. It's entrapment. I was only following the flow of traffic. 'I've spent 10 years as a taxi driver, paying my taxes and working hard, sometimes working 12 hours a day. I've only ever had one ticket in that time. 'I've lost my job now and will lose my badge in August if I don't renew it, which I can't now. to get it back I will have to go through the whole course again.' A friend who attended Mr Holman's court hearing to support him, said: 'Now you've got someone on the dole who doesn't need to be. 'It's not like he was racing through the city at 70mph or something.'
