The phone's front is dominated by its 4.5-inch display with 1080 x 1620 pixels and a 3:2 aspect ratio, and its QWERTY keyboard (which, in addition to having physical keys to type on, is also touch-sensitive, letting you use gestures and swiping). Other highlight features include a Snapdragon 625 processor, a 12 MP rear camera, 3 GB of RAM, and a 3,505 mAh battery. In our BlackBerry KEYone hands-on preview , we're arguing that this is a good looking, well made device, yet it's a niche product - since almost everyone now wants a large display on their smartphone, not a hardware keyboard. Still, in this official blog post , the folks at BlackBerry say the following: \"We’re very confident that customers of all stripes, whether they’re on #TeamBlackBerry, Android loyalists, or anyone who values mobile security and productivity, are going to love KEYone.\" So we're curious to find out how many of our readers are planning to buy the BlackBerry KEYone. In case you're wondering, the smartphone will be sold unlocked for $549, being compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and even Verizon's LTE network. Unfortunately, the KEYone won't be released before April , although registration pages have already gone live in the US and Canada. Phonearena polls Do you plan to buy the BlackBerry KEYone?
