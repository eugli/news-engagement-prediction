I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.\" \nThe Canadiens are not making any more statements about the decision until Wednesday. \nThierren coached the Canadiens for the past eight years and was frequently criticized for his decisions, especially last season when the Canadiens performed abysmally following an injury that took Carey Price off the ice for months. \nThe Canadiens began the current season in spectacular fashion but have done very poorly since early January. They have lost 12 of their last 17 games, although they remain in first place in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. \nJulien was fired at head coach of the Boston Bruins exactly one week ago after nearly ten years with the team. \nJulien had great success with the Bruins in his first years with the team, including winning the Stanley Cup in 2011, but in the past two years the Bruins failed to make the playoffs and this year the Bruins are at risk of not making the playoffs. \nThis is the second time Julien has coached the Canadiens, and that time, he also replaced Therrien. \nThat transition occured in 2002 when the Canadiens were in the middle of a losing stretch. At that point Julien lasted until 2006. Michel Therrien, merci beaucoup pour tout, thank you for giving everything you had to our Team. #GHG â€” Geoff Molson (@GMolsonCHC) February 14, 2017 Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:17:59.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
