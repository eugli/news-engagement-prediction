The couple divorced eight years later.\nWhat is Sports Illustrated?\nChristie has appeared on three previous Sports Illustrated covers Sports Illustrated is a weekly US magazine which has been running since 1954. Being featured on a cover is a huge deal, and carries the same prestige for a model as appearing on the Rolling Stone or Vogue front cover. It is especially renowned for the annual Swimsuit Issue, which comes out every February. Christie Brinkley has previously fronted the swimsuit issue three times before - in 1979, 1980 and 1981. In its editorial, Sports Illustrated said Brinkley was \"out to prove that age is nothing more than a number\".\nSpeaking to People , the model said: \"When I turned 30, I was like, 'This is the last time I'm posing in a bathing suit!'\n\"When this issue comes out, I'll be 63. I thought, 'those days are over'. But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, 'one last go!'.\"\nHer daughter Sailor, 18, said appearing in Sports Illustrated \"has been my dream since I popped out the womb\" in a post on Twitter.\nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
