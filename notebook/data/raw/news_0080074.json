In a statement, AirAsia said a police report has been made by the airline after receiving several complaints from members of the public who fell victim to bogus travel agents. “The airline would like to remind the public to book their flights only through official channels such as the website airasia.com, official websites of its affiliates (such as AirAsiaGo.com) and official sales centres listed on our website,” it said. As a widely known airline in Malaysia and across the region, the AirAsia brand has been repeatedly violated by unscrupulous parties with deceitful motives and intention to cheat the general public. “As a responsible airline, we have been constantly updating the public about the latest scams that have been misusing our brand for illegitimate gains and once again like to advice our guests to stay away from any offers or propositions from third parties claiming to be representing AirAsia. “We will not hesitate to take legal action against individuals or groups who organise illegal schemes using the AirAsia brand,” the budget carrier said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:11:41.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
