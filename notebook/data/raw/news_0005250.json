Jose “Jojo” Yap who has been reassigned as officer in charge (OIC) of the Information and Communications Technology Division (ICTD); National Capital Region Director Ricardo Diaz who will return to his mother unit; the Regional Operations Service, Head Agent Darwin Lising who has been assigned to Bicol and Atty. Roel Bolivar, head of the Task Force against Illegal Drugs. \nDeputy Director for Intelligence Vicente De Guzman III will replace Yap while Atty. Sixto Burgos will be OIC at the Office of the Deputy Director for Intelligence. On the other hand, Atty. Jonathan Galicia will take over the position of Bolivar. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe reshuffle came following the accusation of Superintendent Rafael Dumlao III that Diaz’ men were also involved in Jee’s abduction. \nDumlao has been identified as the brains behind Jee’s abduction and killing based on testimonies of fellow police officer Senior Police Officer 4 Roy Villegas and NBI striker Jerry Omlang. \nGierran, together with PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa, on Wednesday met at the office of Senator Panfilo Lacson. The two have agreed to conduct a joint investigation to solve Jee’s abduction and killing. \nFor the police, team leader will be Senior Supt. Glenn Dumlao, head of PNP’s Anti-Kidnapping Group, and for the NBI, team leader will be Assistant Director Atty. Medardo Delemos.
