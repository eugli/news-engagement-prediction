Predicting where Fremantle will fall is nigh impossible. \nIn the last two seasons the Dockers have tasted the highs of a minor premiership and then the dramatic lows of a bottom three finish. It’s a two-year span which few clubs, if any, in VFL/AFL history have ever gone through. \nMany have tried to explain what happened in 2016 to Fremantle. Blame has been cast on injuries, coaching, the game plan and changes in individual player form. It’s likely all are to blame in some capacity. \nBut then what does that mean for 2017? If the problems are solvable then the Dockers should jump back up into finals contention — bookmakers seem to back this view, with Fremantle eighth or ninth in the market for premiership winner. \nWhat happens though if the change from contender to pretender is permanent? The Dockers have one of the three oldest lists in the competition for the fourth straight year and the most players over the age of 30. \nIf they don’t contend now, they may not for a while. It’s a make or break year. \nLIVE stream every game of the JLT Community Series (the AFL preseason competition) on FOX SPORTS. Get your free 2-week FOXTEL PLAY trial and start watching in minutes. SIGN UP NOW > \n2016 WAS… \nA COLLAPSE of historic proportions. Fremantle had the biggest year-to-year fall in VFL/AFL history, dropping from minor premiers to 16th. While injuries played a big factor — Nat Fyfe and Aaron Sandilands played a combined ten games — even when the Dockers had a full strength side they looked troubled, losing to Gold Coast and Carlton at home in the first five weeks. Coach Ross Lyon delegated more power to his assistants and has now taken it back for 2017 — suggesting he feels that was a major mistake. \nPASS MARK \nIT all depends on the context. If you look at the Dockers’ results last year, you’d say that finishing above 12th would be a success. But the age profile of this list suggests Fremantle should be contending right now because many of their stars — including stalwarts like Aaron Sandilands, David Mundy and Michael Johnson — are in the twilight of their careers. If they’re in the finals race in Round 21, that’s at least a positive sign for the future. NINTH. \nJAKE’S TAKE \n“THE return of Fyfe, Sandilands and Johnson and recruitment of Brad Hill and others will ensure the Dockers improve. But I doubt that will be enough for them to make the finals.” The return of Nat Fyfe will be vital for Fremantle’s chances in 2017. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia \nCHAMPION DATA SAYS… \n“HEADING into 2015 we highlighted concerns around Fremantle’s depth and its offensive ability. We may have been 12 months early, but these concerns became a disastrous reality last season. Whether they can bounce back to the top of the food chain, or are destined to be left as fossils at the bottom of the ladder, is one of the greatest unknowns heading into this year.” - 2017 AFL Prospectus \nTHE TRADE PERIOD \nWho Left: Matthew Pavlich (Retired), Sean Hurley (Delisted), Tanner Smith (Delisted), Anthony Morabito (Delisted), Matt de Boer (Delisted), Michael Barlow (Delisted), Clancee Pearce (Delisted), Tendai Mzungu (Delisted), Jack Hannath (Delisted), Chris Mayne (Collingwood), Alex Silvagni (Delisted) \nWho Arrived: Cam McCarthy (GWS Giants), Bradley Hill (Hawthorn), Joel Hamling (Western Bulldogs), Shane Kersten (Geelong) \nDraft Picks: Griffin Logue (Pick 8), Sean Darcy (Pick 38), Brennan Cox (Pick 41), Luke Ryan (Pick 66) \nRookies: Taylin Duman (Pick 3), Luke Strnadica (Pick 21), Brady Grey (Pick 38), Josh Deluca-Cardillo (Pick 50) \nTHE Dockers have reloaded on the fly, trying to fight their way back into the finals with four additions from other clubs who could prove valuable. \nCam McCarthy, Brad Hill, Joel Hamling and Shane Kersten all slot in to the important 21-24 age group, adding talented youth to a side that desperately needed it. But there are still question marks there, particularly around McCarthy who has played just 21 AFL games. \nKersten will need to step up as he and McCarthy will likely be the Dockers’ top two key forwards, with Matthew Pavlich now in the Fox Footy commentary booth and Matt Taberner rated below average by Champion Data . \nTHE COACH \nROSS Lyon isn’t going anywhere. That may be for the best. \nWith a contract keeping him at the Dockers until the end of 2020, Lyon will get to make the call as to whether Fremantle continues its current tilt at a flag or steps back and rebuilds for a run at the finals at the end of the decade. \nThe moves made in the trade period suggest Lyon and his coaching panel believe in this list. \nBut they didn’t go all in, selecting defender Griffin Logue with pick eight in the national draft. The Ross of old — or more accurately, the Ross doing everything he can to win now — would have traded that pick out. \nThere was plenty of commentary around the idea that Lyon’s game style failed in 2016 because there were fewer stoppages, meaning the Dockers couldn’t control the flow of the game as well. On average in 2015 Fremantle games had 72.5 stoppages; in 2016, that number dropped to 65.3. \nBut that’s less than two fewer stoppages per quarter. That hardly sounds like something that would send a premiership contender into the bottom four so quickly. \nWe’ll know whether Lyon’s style can still work by looking at the Dockers’ defence this upcoming season. Fremantle was 14th in points allowed in 2016; under Lyon they had never been worse than a top two defence, while Lyon’s St Kilda teams were never worse than seventh.

Champion Data ’s AFL Player Ratings system suggests that on average, a Fremantle side with Fyfe scores two more goals than a team without him. \nIt was clear looking at the Dockers’ stoppage numbers why he was so important. Fremantle was first in the AFL in 2015 for clearances and points scored from centre bounces; in 2016, they were 12th and 13th respectively. The numbers for ball-ups and throw-ins were similar if not quite as bad. \nFremantle already had scoring concerns heading into last season but it became clear throughout 2016 that if the Dockers can’t score coming out of clearances, they can barely score at all. \nA healthy Fyfe will ensure they at least have a fighting chance in 2017. \nTHE NEXT BIG THING \nONE of the few shining lights from 2016 for the Dockers was the emergence of midfielder Connor Blakely. \nThe West Australian, who turns 21 in March, played 15 games last season after Fyfe went down and slotted in as an inside midfielder to some success. \nBlakely averaged over 20 disposals and just under nine contested possessions a game, receiving three Brownlow votes against the Brisbane Lions in Round 12 after collecting 29 touches, 14 contested possessions and seven clearances. \nHe is emerging at the perfect time as well, given the advanced age of David Mundy. Blakely also starred during the WAFL finals series. The emergence of midfielder Connor Blakely was a bright spot for Fremantle in 2016.

At his best he can be a real difference-maker. \nSUPERCOACH MUST HAVE \nNAT Fyfe (MID, $573,500) is the most popular pick in SuperCoach, owned in over half of all teams. He was the number one player in the game in 2015 and is now the 30th-most expensive player in 2017. Value! \nWHY SHOULD IT BE YOUR SECOND CLUB? \nAFTER the Bulldogs ended their premiership drought, suddenly there’s room for footy fans to jump to a new ‘it would be nice if they won it, wouldn’t it?’ club. \nGiven they’ve never won a flag Fremantle is well placed to be that team. Plus, they’ve got one of the best players in the competition, and purple is an aesthetically pleasing colour. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
