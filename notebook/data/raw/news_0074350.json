Plenty of room to play, sleep, eat.\" \nBarney and Bambi were just two of the 753 animals who went to new homes last week in a NSW-wide, three-day \"clear the shelter\" campaign by the RSPCA. \nAll animals were sold for $29. \nThe sale topped last year's record of 596 animals adopted in three days. \n\"This is about finding homes for animals,\" Brendon Neilly, executive manager of the RSPCA's animal care services, told ABC Radio Sydney . \n\"We see more animals coming in every day [and] this is a way of motivating people to adopt, rather than picking up an animal on Gumtree or those sorts of places.\" \nAmong those adopted at the Sydney shelter were ducks, chickens, dogs, cats, rabbits, a ferret and a goat.

(ABC Radio Sydney: Amanda Hoh) \nBy Friday afternoon alone, the shelter had sold about 300 animals and had eager pet owners lining outside the door before opening time. \nIn Rutherford in the Hunter region, 123 animals were adopted, including five Shetland ponies, one sheep, two pigs, 54 dogs and 27 cats. \nHunter regional manager Debbie Jaggers said the promotional weekend was \"enormously different\" compared to regular weekends which usually saw about 20 adoptions. Checking new owner backgrounds \nOn Facebook, a spokesperson for the RSPCA responded to concerns regarding return rates and \"undesirable adopters adopting animals due to the reduced price\". External Link: RSPCA photo \nThey assured people their \"normal adoption procedures\" were followed over the weekend, including background checks, as well as having the animals desexed, microchipped, vaccinated and vet checked before adoption. \nThey added that return rates had no correlation with discount weekends, with return rates for the past five years averaging around 5 per cent. \nMr Neilly said for this first time the organisation had committed to keeping in contact with adopters for three to six months to check on their progress with their new pets. \n\"We look at what the animal is going to need in the home, so if this is an animal that has restrictions like mobility issues, we make sure your environment matches the animal's environment,\" he said. \n\"We want to make sure this is something that is positive for the animals and families.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:15:37.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
