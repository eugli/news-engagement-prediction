Guests will be able to pump, twist and turn water while learning about conservation.\nOnly a short drive away from the Sea Life Aquarium is Scottsdale's OdySea Aquarium, which opened last July.\nSea Life spokeswoman Elizabeth Mathews said there's not much competition between the two because she said aquariums work with each other to promote conservation.\n\"We really focus on conservation and how we can protect the environment from a mainland city that's not even near an ocean,\" Mathews said.\nShe said there's been a growing interest in bringing ocean life to the Valley and the exhibit aims to capitalize on that to educate guests about conservation.\nMORE: Take a peek inside these metro Phoenix aquariums \nSea Life also has a freshwater exhibit that houses creatures native to Arizona's Salt River, a tidepool where guests can touch creatures such as sea stars and urchins, stingray and seahorse exhibits, a live coral reef, and an ocean view exhibit that's home to sharks and a rescued sea turtle.\nMathews said the latest exhibit will be aimed at children, who they hope will take away important lessons about humans' impact on ocean life.\n\"It's good for kids to learn at a young age how local conservation efforts can help impact the ocean environment,\" Mathews said.\nMathews said the exhibit will teach kids how to help protect their favorite sea creatures by doing things like picking up trash to prevent it from entering waterways.\n“The Colorado River exhibit ups the ante when it comes to interactive, hands-on learning and fun,” Joanna Hobday, Sea Life Arizona Aquarium’s general manager, said in a written statement. “It’s a great way for kids to learn more about their local waterways and the animals that call the Sea of Cortez home.”\nThe exhibit is expected to open in late spring.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Photos: Sea Life Arizona Aquarium   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
