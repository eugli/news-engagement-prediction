Our patron is Robbie Coltrane, OBE. #PrideoftheClyde Feb 17 Nicola Sturgeon MSP visits famous Scots steamship The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, MSP for Glasgow Southside, has visited TS Queen Mary, Scotland’s last remaining turbine steamship which was saved from scrap last year by charity Friends of TS Queen Mary. During the First Minister’s visit to the ship, which is berthed at Glasgow Science Centre in her constituency, Ms Sturgeon met with Officer Cadets from Clyde Marine Training, currently studying to become Merchant Navy Officers at the City of Glasgow College. The college and training provider have agreed to partner with Friends of TS Queen Mary in providing labour during the ship’s restoration. This will be a unique opportunity for the officer cadets to learn first-hand about the craftsmanship and engineering which went into 1930s Clyde-built vessels. Nicola Sturgeon MSP said: “Govan’s shipbuilding tradition is second to none and I was delighted to visit TS Queen Mary and see first-hand the work being done to restore this vital part of our heritage. This is a fantastic project and provides a great opportunity for young people to get involved in the restoration.” Colin McMurray, Managing Director of Clyde Marine Training, said: “This is a fantastic opportunity for our cadets and a great project to work on. Partnering with Friends of TS Queen Mary during the restoration project will help to give these young people the skills they need for a future in the maritime industry.” Iain Sim, Trustee of charity Friends of TS Queen Mary, said: “I am delighted to welcome the First Minister to look around TS Queen Mary and learn more about our project. This historic ship has an important place in Scotland’s heritage, as the last surviving turbine steamship. However, she also plays an important part in our future too. Once restored, we hope she will help inspire the next generation of Scottish engineering talent.” The charity has so far raised around just over £800,000. Of that, £500,000 has been invested in the restoration of the ship, counting towards the overall target. As funding continues to become available, the Charity continues to invest in the restoration, with the hope that the ship can re-open to the public in spring 2018. The project has already received support from Glasgow Science Centre, Strathclyde University, Glasgow School of Art and the University of Dundee, as well as a handful of corporate sponsors including Deloittes, AkzoNobel and Clydesdale Bank.
