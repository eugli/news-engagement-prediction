Located approximately 40 light-years away from Earth, the star has seven Earth-like planets orbiting around it. Background \nOn February 22nd, 2017, NASA held a press conference to announce a major update on its recent discovery of TRAPPIST -1, an ultra-cool dwarf star located about 40 light-years away from Earth in the Aquarius constellation, during which the scientists revealed there are seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the star, including three that lie within the circumstellar habitable zone where liquid water and life. All but one of the seven planets are likely thought to be rocky planets. TRAPPIST \nThe TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope–South ( TRAPPIST ) is a Belgian optic robotic telescope that specializes in scanning the sky in search of comets and exoplanets. Operated by a team of astronomers at the University of Liège in Belgium and located at the La Silla Observatory in the Atacama Desert, Chile, the telescope went online in 2010, and after six years of operation, it confirmed the discovery of a red dwarf star with planets in the habitable zone, which came to be known as TRAPPIST -1, in May 2016. Developments \nOn the day before the announcement, \nFollowing the announcement, the information was “posted on the subreddit /r/space, gaining upwards of 33,000 upvotes in the span of three hours [2] ,” and “also began trending on social media sites such as Twitter [3] ,” frequently being discussed using the hashtag #trappist1.
