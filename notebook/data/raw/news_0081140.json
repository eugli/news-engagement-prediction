Story continues below \nThe proposed legislation follows consultation with groups including the B.C. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the Canadian Kennel Clug, the Canadian Cat Association, as well as individual breeders and local governments. \n“The partnership the B.C. government and the BC SPCA have built continues to strengthen animal welfare in British Columbia, including around the breeding of our most common family pets,” Letnick said. “The framework for the licensing and registration of commercial breeders of cats and dogs in B.C. is the latest step in our efforts to develop a system that ensures puppies and kittens in B.C. are treated with the care and respect they deserve. Our intent is clear: we want a system that is supported by the responsible breeders in B.C. and targets the ones that aren’t.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:16.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
