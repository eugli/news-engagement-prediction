'However, we will be conducting a joint-investigation with Buckinghamshire Fire & Rescue Service to determine the cause. 'Representatives from Milton Keynes Council also attended the scene.' Police said a cordon is in place at the scene but no other buildings have been affected. A school spokesman said: 'We are co-operating fully with the relevant authorities in this investigation. There were about 40 people in the hall when an 8ft by 5ft section of the ceiling collapsed at just after 3.30pm today 'Our thoughts are of course with this child and her family at this very difficult time.' A message on the school's website says: 'Unfortunately there has been an incident at Southwood School today where a part of the internal ceiling of the hall has fallen. 'We have been checked by Health and Safety officers who have confirmed that the building is safe, but obviously the hall will be out of use for some time.' The storm has claimed several casualties across the nation, including a woman who was killed by a flying piece of debris outside a Starbucks in Wolverhampton.
