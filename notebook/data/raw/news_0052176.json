He is a Hollywood elitist.” \nPrior to running for president, Trump was the host of NBC’s The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice and has made cameos in movies and TV shows including Home Alone 2 , Zoolander , and The Nanny . According to a financial disclosure form he submitted during his presidential campaign, Trump has a $110,228 pension from the Screen Actors Guild. \nAs for Bannon, Clooney continued, “Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director. That’s the truth, that’s what he’s done. He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L.A. riots that he couldn’t get made. He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld. He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean that’s the reality.” \nClooney, a Hillary Clinton supporter and former costar of Streep’s, says the Oscar-winner has “every right to speak up.” \n“She was an American citizen long before she was an icon,” he added. \nYou can watch more of Clooney’s Canal+ interview in the video above.
