The onus for scams worth ₹12 lakh crore during UPA does rest on the Congress and the former PM,” Shah said a poll rally in Tehri. \nIn an apparent reference to the “maut ka saudagar” (merchant of death) remark made by Sonia, Shah \nasked Rahul to think of the remarks recently made by the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and his own “khoon ki dalali” remark against the PM. \nShah said that Rahul was the first to show disrespect to Manmohan Singh by publicly tearing to pieces an ordinance passed by him. \nAttacking Rahul for repeatedly demanding a report card of Modi government’s performance, the BJP president said, “The BJP’s turn to give a report card will come in 2019.” \nthe BJP president also took a jibe at Manmohan Singh. “Our party’s first achievement is that it gave a PM who can speak. Before him there was a PM whose voice could be heard only by you and your mother,” Shah said. \nHe also launched a scathing attack on chief minister Harish Rawat. “Rawat is the only chief minister in the country who was seen negotiating a bribery deal in a CD. Ministers are looting the state in league with the liquor mafia and corruption under him has reached its peak,” the BJP chief said. \nThe BJP leader was referring to the alleged sting operation on April 29 purportedly showing Rawat offering bribe to rebel Congress MLAs to support him during a floor test in the Assembly. \nAccusing Rawat of “always complaining” about Uttarakhand’s lack of resources and difficult terrain rather than doing something for its development, Shah said the CM “lacks the determination” to take the state on the path of progress. \nCharging Rawat with always “looking for avenues to mint money”, Shah said, “Harish Bhai where there is a will there is a way! You cannot do it because your attention lies somewhere else, perhaps on ways to make money.” \nAsking Rawat to “give up as he has run out of ideas”, he said the BJP will develop Uttarakhand into a model state by “setting up IT parks in the hills on the lines of New York and New Jersey”. \nBesides, the state’s huge wealth of medicinal plants will be tapped to meet international demand, Shah said. \nThe BJP president also slammed Rawat for being “ungrateful” to the PM who had “gifted” 900 km all-weather ‘chardham’ roads to the state. \nWITH PTI ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:39.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
