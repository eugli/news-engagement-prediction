She told the Telegraph that she believes they washed up with the morning tide. \n\"[When] we got closer we realised it was jellyfish,\" she told the BBC. \"It was like bubble wrap across the beach.\" Blue blubber jellyfish is the most common jellyfish in south-east Queensland Credit: Charlotte Lawson \n\"Jellyfish bloom is part of their lifecycle and if the winds blow just right and if the water level falls with the tide, then they get stranded,\" marine biologist Dr Lisa-Ann Gershwin, who specialises in jellyfish, told ABC News . \n\"We see jellyfish bloom, but not like this, this is jaw dropping,\" the biologist said, adding the bloom, which she described as a \"wallpaper of jellyfish\", was the biggest she had seen in her 25 years of research. \nM s Lawson told the Brisbane Times that while the bloom happens every year \"there's never been this many, this year it's been heaps.\" \n\"There was only a metre of sand between the jellyfish and the concrete,\" she said, estimating the jellyfish carpet was between four to six metres wide.

Ms Lawson told the Telegraph on Friday that \"just a couple\" of them are left. \nDr Gershwin said she believed the combination of factors including northerly winds, tide conditions and warmer waters caused the jellyfish to strand in such numbers.
