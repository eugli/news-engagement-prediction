Virginia Tech's president has no comment about one of its most famous alumni, White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. \nThe president of Trinity Washington University, though, has had plenty to say about one of its graduates. \"Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration's war on immigrants among many other issues,\" Patricia McGuire wrote recently. \nUniversity presidents used to be part of the national dialogue, decades ago when the demands of the job were less complicated and the need for fundraising less consuming. But it has long been unusual for a college to single out a graduate for criticism, especially as college and university presidents are expected to build community among a diverse group of students, faculty, staff and alumni, to foster pride in the institution, and to raise money and support from people on all sides of the political spectrum. \nBecause of the importance of alumni to fundraising, said Terry Hartle of the American Council on Education, \"presidents tread very carefully. Losing the support of alumni is a very bad idea.\" \nBut McGuire, the longtime president of the small women's college in Northeast Washington, said she felt a moral imperative to speak out against the Trump administration - in particular for its policies on immigration and its lack of truthfulness - and Conway is not exempt from that. \nConway said by phone Friday she was surprised to find her alma mater's social media feed full of partisan retweets and snarky comments. \"It's a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,\" she said, citing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as an example, \"attack me, and never have the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion.\" McGuire had looked at her comments through the most negative lens possible, she said. \nMcGuire never hesitated to call her to ask for donations to Trinity, Conway added. She and her husband donated $50,000 to a 1999-2002 Trinity fundraising campaign. \"My money was good.\" \nWhile a few college presidents have taken a strong public stand against President Trump, and hundreds have signaled their opposition to his immigration policies, Trinity stands out for the volume and tone of its messages. \nThrough its institutional and its president's social media messages, the university has been sharply and repeatedly critical of Trump, his policies and many of his top advisers. \nThey haven't held back on their alumna, either. \n\"I get better treatment from Robby Mook,\" Conway said, of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign manager, \"than I do from the president of the university I attended.\" \nTrinity has been quick to praise other alumnae, many of them Democrats, such as former Obama administration Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius - who is prominently displayed on the school's home page highlighting women graduates \"shattering glass ceilings\" -- and Pelosi, but also some Republicans, as well as honorary alumnae. \nFor a small Catholic women's college to have as their alumnae both the first female Speaker of the House and the first female presidential campaign manager, Conway said, and to \"look at the disparate treatment of the two of us, tells the entire tale.\" \nShe asked why she didn't see concern expressed about Pelosi's support for abortion rights, or mention of her own speech at the recent March for Life, which signaled high-level administration support for the cause. \"Does she not think there are pro-life alumnae?\" \nConway said McGuire clearly sees her position and the role of the university as one \"that is peddling a very narrowly subscribed political viewpoint.\" \nMcGuire said it's not about politics. (She also said the university does not support Pelosi's support for abortion rights.) \"People can agree or disagree around national policy or domestic policy. You can have a raging debate about Obamacare . . . But when you lie so consistently as this administration does, that's a moral issue. We are teachers. We have an honor system here. We believe deeply in upholding the value of truth. . . . it's urgent not to be shy about it.\" \nMcGuire said some alumnae have criticized her for not honoring Conway. \nBut she said she has gotten hundreds of messages from alumnae whom she described as appalled by Conway. \"I don't go around denouncing our alumnae,\" she said, but \"I want to be on the record: We don't condone lying. We can't say someone is exempt from that.\" \n\"In offering criticism, it's meant to be a call to a higher standard of behavior.\" \nThere was a time, during Civil Rights battles and the Vietnam War, when university presidents were visible figures in national conversations. Some great public figures spoke out on the dominant issues of their times, said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College. That changed, he said, when fundraising and management became more important for college presidents than ideals and scholarship and public service. \nThis is a different moment, he said, one that transcends partisan politics. \"Truth-telling is a crucial element of democracy, a true and absolutely indispensable component of any true definition of freedom. . . . \n\"If we don't stand up for what we believe, we have nobody to blame at the end but ourselves.\" \nBut some, at a time when many college campuses have been criticized as too liberal and out of touch, argue university presidents no longer speak for the nation. \n\"To me, university leadership has felt enormously partisan. . .\" said Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"That factors into seeing this as cheap partisan thuggery rather than any serious commitment to robust civic debate.\" Of all the university graduates who had been convicted of crimes over the years, he asked rhetorically, how many have been singled out by their school? \nHe added, \"Criticism is appropriate and valid - people have points of view. But I think it's striking how incredibly uniform higher education is.\" \nMcGuire benefits, Hartle said, from being a very established president with strong support from the board, faculty and alumnae (and not having to answer to state legislators, as a public university president would), which makes it possible for her to speak out about something she feels strongly about. \n\"This reflects her strong personal commitment to social justice and educational opportunity and the nature of her student body,\" Hartle said. \nTrinity, one of the oldest Catholic women's colleges in the U.S., has changed dramatically over the years. It's still a private school, but the undergraduate program now has a particular emphasis on reaching people facing significant hurdles to higher education, such as single mothers and women from low-income families. More than 95 percent of the students are black, Latina or mixed race, and some of their most academically outstanding students are \"dreamers\" working to achieve legal immigration status, who are now feeling personally at risk.
