General manager Danny Ainge has been angling Boston to turn all of the wheeling and dealing he's helmed over the years into a star player as the franchise ramps up to become a contender. \nGeorge is one of the NBA's premiere perimeter players and would be a huge upgrade in the wings for Boston. It's unclear what other players Indiana would seek to go with either the Nets' 2017 first-round pick or '18 first round, but there are plenty of options to consider. \nTrade discussions around getting Butler to Boston hinged on the inclusion of Jae Crowder, which the Celtics weren't interested in . The asking price for George may be different. \nBoston may balk at paying too much for George, though, who reportedly has his eyes on potentially signing with his hometown team in the Los Angeles Lakers when he can become a free agent in 2018. \nTrading a blockbuster package only for their return to walk away as a free agent would be a huge blow for Boston, but rolling the dice and finally turning years of asset-gathering into a tangible star could help put the Celtics over the top in the Eastern Conference. \nShould Boston finally go all-in to get their star player, or should they hold on and continue playing it safe?
