As far as he's concerned, they are just numbers on a spreadsheet.\" \nLabor's move is likely to have backing from the Greens and independent senator Jacqui Lambie, who says there is no way she could support any Sunday penalty rate cuts. \nUnions want all politicians to join them. \n\"Malcolm Turnbull has shown he is prepared to overturn the senate and statutory bodies in order to take rights away from workers,\" ACTU president Ged Kearney said on Sunday, citing the double dissolution election over the building industry watchdog, and laws on truck driver and firefighter conditions. \n\"Now he has a chance to act for workers.\" \nThe Greens took credit for Labor's legislative move after the minor party released a draft bill to also stop the penalty rate cuts. \nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann accused Labor of undermining the independence of an organisation it set up. \n\"I did not conduct the review, the government did not conduct the review; the Fair Work Commission conducted the review,\" he told Sky News \n\"The government has got absolutely no reason to disagree or second-guess the conclusions that they have reached.\" \nHe pointed out Mr Shorten had promised during last year's federal election campaign to respect the commission's decision. \nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said Labor's leadership team had decided to change that position in January once it became clear the commission was likely to recommend cutting pay rates. \nLabor also plans to make another submission to the Fair Work Commission as it decides how and when the rate cuts should be implemented.
