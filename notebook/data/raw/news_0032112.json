The league wanted its brand accounts to stop mocking other teams, which led to the Hawks and Kings becoming best friends . \nBut something didn't feel right . This is sports, and there will always be a winner and a loser. The Dallas Stars recognized that with this amazing tweet. @PredsNHL let's all have fun and have a good game toda...wait, wrong leaguewe hope we win and you lose. because this is sports. — Dallas Stars (@DallasStars) February 12, 2017 \nNicely done, Stars. That's how it should be. \nThe Predators were also in the spirit of trolling the NBA. . @DallasStars well, we don't like you. So there. Go sports! — Nashville Predators (@PredsNHL) February 12, 2017 \nSports!
