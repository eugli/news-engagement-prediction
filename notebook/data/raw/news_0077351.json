Problems are said to have begun when Mrs Brindle paid for a mock Ofsted inspection. It led to new rules being brought in which teachers say greatly increased their workload. Children reported seeing teachers crying in corridors, and a long-serving member of staff was allegedly suspended. Fourteen teachers and two assistants lodged grievances with the governing body, which are so far unresolved. Eight governors also resigned. Worried parents then set up a WhatsApp online messaging group to discuss what was going on at the school, which was rated 'outstanding' in 2007. But when Mrs Brindle, 40, heard they were talking over the internet, she sent letters to the parents of all 450 pupils, warning she would sue if her reputation was harmed. The teachers and some parents are thought to have been chanting about the headteacher She wrote: 'A number of social media posts have been made which are damaging to the reputation of the head and the school. Some are potentially libellous and leave individuals vulnerable to legal action.' A mother, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'She's come here and ruined our school. We're an outstanding school. I just feel like she's tried to sabotage the school. 'At the end of the day Trafford have said she has still got her position, she is still in the school but I swear we will not put our kids in that school with that headteacher. 'We've fought too hard, things have gone too far. She's like a dragon.' Teachers captured in the video are understood to have been celebrating an apparent victory in their battle against the leadership at Bollin And it appears that those at the party believed Mrs Brindle was being ousted Earlier this month, 17 of Bollin's 21 teachers walked out in protest. More than 900 people signed a 'no confidence' petition and Trafford Council last week issued a warning about the way the school is run. Peter Middleman, from the National Union of Teachers, said members had met with the head, but reached no compromise. The incidents appear to have come to a head after Trafford Council intervened and closed the school yesterday morning. Today, the school remained closed for pupils as teachers and staff were locked in an emergency meeting with Trafford Council. One man who came out of the building said: 'We've been told not to speak, I'm afraid I can't say what was going on. I can't comment sorry.' Some teachers could be seen removing boxes and musical instruments from the main reception and putting them into the boot of their cars. It's understood that parents have not been able to get any information from the school or council about the situation and have been relying on news reports to keep up to date.

Pictured is a member of staff leaving the school It's understood that parents have not been able to get any information from the school or council about the situation and have been relying on news reports to keep up to date One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'I respect that Trafford Council will have their processes, but all the children were told that Mrs Marshall was taking the role at an assembly yesterday. 'The council have not given us any answers - they are just saying she has not been suspended or sacked. We don't know when the children will be back at school. 'The kids are all very upset by it all and we just hope it gets resolved soon. 'But I'm willing to take a little bit of pain to say bye to her. It got the point where parents and teachers felt they weren't able to do or say anything - this is not North Korea, this is Bowdon in Cheshire. 'What you saw in the video was the relief of the teachers. They were obviously letting off a bit of steam and somehow the video has gone out. 'But the party wasn't anything nasty. It was a spontaneous get together, because in the last few months they have been crying and been off sick at times due to everything going on.' Some teachers could be seen removing boxes and musical instruments from the main reception and putting them into the boot of their cars today Around 70 parents also protested outside the school. Parents were contacted to collect their children and say they haven't been told when the school will open again. Teachers captured in the video are understood to have been celebrating an apparent victory in their battle against the leadership at Bollin. And it appears that those at the party believed Mrs Brindle was being ousted. An investigation into the video and the circumstances surrounding the footage has been launched by the council, a spokesman said. Other parents have been divided by the contents of the video. One described it as 'an orderly celebration following a difficult few months' at the school. Another, who asked not to be identified, said she was 'disgusted' by the video and its contents. The parent said: 'I am absolutely disgusted and ashamed by it, and now we are having to suffer for the consequences.'

Staff have filed sixteen grievances since September and the row reached a head this week when teachers staged a strike. Around 70 parents also protested outside the school A spokeswoman from Trafford Council said: 'Trafford Council and the Governors of The Bollin Primary School have agreed to close the school with immediate effect. 'This decision has not been taken lightly but is necessary to ensure the safe operation of the school in the light of concerns about the reduced capacity of the senior leadership at the school. The school will be closed until further notice, although the council reinforced its priority is to put measures in place so the school can reopen as soon as possible. 'The council is also aware of a film that is circulating in relation to the school and is investigating this further. 'Whilst we appreciate this matter will be a disruption to the pupils and family life, it is of the utmost importance to safeguard and protect pupils at the school.'
