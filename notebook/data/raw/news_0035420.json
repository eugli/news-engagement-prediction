(Photo: Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Western Conference All-Star team is particularly interesting this year because of what happened over the summer: Kevin Durant decided to join the Warriors, while Russell Westbrook stayed on the Thunder. \nSo now, the West team consists of four Warriors players - Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green - plus head coach Steve Kerr, and then there's the odd man out in Westbrook. As USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick put it , it's like Westbrook is being forced to eat at a five-star restaurant \"with with the ex - and their friends - not long after you both endured the most bitter of breakups.\" \nBut considering everything that happened, including the intense Thunder-Warriors matchup just last weekend, how crazy amazing would it be to see Westbrook play on the court alongside four Warriors? \nThe fans want to see it, and so does Green's mom, Mary Babers-Green. Draymond's mom is rooting for all 4 Warriors and Russell Westbrook to be played together. Because aren't we all? pic.twitter.com/RQCjEA9Pct — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) February 17, 2017 \nShe has been waiting to see this since at least last month. Steve Kerr says at some point during the All-Star Game that he will \"absolutely\" play his Big 4 together. — Chris Haynes (@ChrisBHaynes) January 27, 2017 @AlexKennedyNBA @ChrisBHaynes give that ALL STAR GAME LIFE! Will be fun & exciting! #SAUCE — WARRIORMOM (@BabersGreen) January 27, 2017 \nI'm pretty sure a lot of NBA fans have been looking forward to seeing what might happen at this All-Star Game ever since Westbrook and Durant went through their summer breakup. \nWould there be drama on the court? Would they play like everything was normal? Would Westbrook refuse to pass the ball to the Warriors, or would the Warriors refuse to pass the ball to him? Will Twitter just break the moment it happens? \nAnything feels possible.
